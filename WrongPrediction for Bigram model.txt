Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available.

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South ,

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

To alert you to another item that may arise:  Some industrials have air
permits that restrict them to running for self-supply backup generation
only.  In such case, the air permit may have to be amended by the industrial
before it can sell to the grid.  Feel free to call upon Gov't Affairs if you
have a question about this.

Hello...
Despite my thoughts, you like baseball.   So the question is do you like art
(as in musuems)  ?
I'm leaning towards yes but don't know for sure.


We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline".

We have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

Our planned Re-Launch timetable is as follows:


Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with the new Buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Subusers.

A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.

Trading/Origination Coordination

We will shortly be sending you an invitation to join a meeting in which we will be discussing launch plans in more detail and looking for people to help in contacting customers on our Top 50 list. Although we have a dedicated EnronOnline marketing team, we would appreciate assistance from traders and originators who have strong relationships with our customers and can assist in getting signed PA's returned to us.

If you have any questions please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

Hi all,
We have updated the PSIM model. The current version can handle more realistic
operational constraints by selecting "Semi Optimal Dispatch" toggle for Dispatch
Mode. This dispatch mode considers minimum up hours, minimum down hours,
ramp-up hours, start up cost, fuel switching cost, forward looking within a
user-specified period of time. It also allows user to enter their estimate of ISO
curtailment on their generation capacity by month in "Asset" page.

help files in one directory of your choice.

Hi everyone,
We have another Brown Bag Lunch on Option Pricing this Friday, June 8, 12 noon at 19C2.

Sevil will demonstrate PJM Bid Profiler,  a tool or an application that is used by some of the
North East traders to look at unit specific energy bids in daily auction of PJM and NePool.
This tool was created by using Delphi and Perl (database programming languages).

Come and enjoy it.

Best,
Zimin, Alex

I want to move forward with scheduling the initial meeting of the Operational Risk Management task force.  How does Tuesday, October 16th and the afternoon of Thursday, October 18th look for everyone?  Please let me know your schedule for both of these dates.  Most of the task force members have been identified, with the exception of those from GRMO and IT.  Sally Beck will identify representatives from these two areas.  I would also expect that other individuals may be consulted from time to time as additional expertise or resources or required.

I intend to schedule a two-hour block of time for this meeting.  The agenda will include, at a minimum,  the following topics:

Definition of Operational Risk for  Enron - What's in and What's Out
Preliminary Goals for Operational Risk Management (to be refined by the group)
Develop Common Language
Identify Framework for Monitoring Risk
Role of this task force  - Strategy
Set common objectives for implementation this year and a look forward to 2002
Current Initiatives
Communications Plan
Open Discussion - Other Ideas from the group
- Suggestions re other groups/individuals to include on the task force


I am excited about leading this initiative for Enron.  We have a unique opportunity to define operational risk measurement for Enron, develop reporting guidelines, and provide qualitative assessments of operational risk, all of which will be considered during the risk capital allocation process.   But most importantly, we can identify ways to mitigate Enron's exposure to operational risk.  Please call if you would like to discuss any of the above prior to the meeting.

Thanks,
Wanda Curry

Yes, I'll ask her, but I also know someone else that sings at weddings professionally!  Do you know what song?


EnronOnline/NetCoOnline status update:
- "NetCoOnline" will be distinct from EnronOnline, with much the same functionality and a refreshed look.
- We will carry data to support the same gas and power products as were on EnronOnline. Please contact us if you will need different products from what was on EnronOnline.
- We have prepared a list of top customers in CDN and US Gas and Power (copy attached), which we will be using as a guide in chasing signed Password Applications.
- To speed the registration process, top customers will be preloaded into the system for activation as soon as we receive their Password Application.
- We are intending to use a simple, online GTC, which can be superceded by a negotiated Master Agreement, as with EnronOnline.
- Internal trader names have been circulated to each desk head for approval.

PSim meeting has been rescheduled to start at 9:30 am, same location.


Dear everyone,

We understand the as members of Enron Research group, all of us are working
on very interesting projects, some of which are ground-breaking, and we all
keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology.  We also find
out, through our own experience, that at this age of information explosion,
it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep
abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department, let
alone in the industry.  It is also our personal experience that many a
project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of
this group.

As a remedy, we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag
lunch group meeting, once every two weeks on Friday, for about 50 minutes.
It is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new
technology and development, as well as with each other,s work, so that we do
not have to reinvent the wheels.

We envision the following: In this meeting (or seminar), each one of us will
take turns to make presentations to the group. The topics could range from
theoretical consideration to practical implementation, be it option pricing,
process modelling, insurance issue, or Monte Carlo simulation, or anything
one finds fascinating.  The presentation material could be papers you have
been reading recently, projects you are working on,  some problem that
bothers you, or an idea that is fascinating. You  choose your own
presentation style.  It could be
everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask, hand waving
style, or it can involve nitty-gritty, detailed derivations, anyway a style
that suits you and the topic.  Or it can simply be a dry-run for your
presentation at the next Risk Conference.  Zimin and Alex will take upon the
responsibility of organizing the seminar.

We hope the seminar will be up and running in two-three weeks. For that
purpose your support will be greatly appreciated. Please let either Zimin or
Alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and
provide a tentative schedule. Surely the rest of the group will be happy to
hear your presentation.

We encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting, either to give a
talk or just sit in.

Alex Huang

Claudette and TJ -- Please forward to your groups.  Thanks.

On October 17, 2001 Rockland Electric Company and PJM filed with FERC a joint application for the transfer of operational control from the NYISO to PJM of certain facilities located in Northern New Jersey.  The facilities are the transmission assets in the Eastern Division of Rockland's service territory.  This includes approximately 400 MW of load in Bergen County, NJ and transmission facilities that are already directly interconnected with PJM (note that other Rockland facilities located in NJ, namely those in northern Passaic County and Sussex County (Rockland's Central and Western Divisions respectively) will not be transferred to PJM and will remain under the operational control of the NYISO since these facilities are not directly interconnected with PJM nor with Rockland's Eastern Division).  The filing requests approval of the transfer by November 30, 2001 which would allow PJM to take operational control on February 1, 2002 (the filing does not address what, if any, changes to the operation date might be if FERC does not approve this by Nov 30).  Rockland Electric is a subsidiary of Orange & Rockland Utilities which is a subsidiary of Con Edison.

The transfer adds approximately 400 MW of load and 56,000 customers (mostly residential and commercial) to PJM.  There is no increase in supply, therefore the total load of PJM is increased by 400 MW without any additional resources.  The transmission assets include 138-kV (8.3 miles), 69-kV (35.9 miles) and 35-kV (12.4 miles) transmission lines and 11 substations (the filing includes a detailed description of these assets).

Let me know if you require any additional information.

Congrats on your new job..


Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results.

There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

Attached for comments/discussion is the gov't affairs' draft proposal for an
Enron model for RTOs.  This includes the flowgate transmission rights model.
We are also working on a new open access tariff based on this model.  RTO
proposals are due to FERC 10/15.   Thanks.


I believe Wabash has also terminated.
Don,
As you know, we had a meeting like this the week prior to Christmas and had an accurate list at that time.   Our group can do nothing about delays between actual termination notification by the counterparty and communication to trading that termination has occurred.   I think the meeting is warranted, however, we are not going to completely eliminate the timing issues.
I will see you on Wednesday at 2:00 pm.

Hey Sugar Bear!


I was just thinking about you and was hoping that everything is going okay
for you.  I constantly keep you in prayer regarding your situation.   How's
Erika doing?

You missed church Sunday when they forceably removed one of the guys (aaron
Burr) from the church.  You remember he was the one that used to sit on the
front row and get happy alllllllllll the time.  You remember him, anyway they
hauled his tail out of there.  It was terrible to see someone hauled from the
church, not matter what the situation is.

Oh well, take care, and call me if we need to talk!!!!


My brother was coming back from London to go so I went out and paid a fortune
from a scalper for two....


I really do appreciate it though..


I would like to get you all set up with the RAC website (icon above).  This will enable you to see your daily VaR, drill down to VaR by risk type, by month and run VaR scenarios.

This is where we pull in our information for the VaR report we publish each morning, and with this you won't have to wait for us to publish before you can see the numbers.

Everyone has been granted access to the east desk VaR and some of you are already set up with your defaults on the website.

For those who aren't................

Copy this icon to your desktop
Once you enter the site (rac.enron.com) click on "Market Details" on the bottom of the list on the left
The top left box (VaR) will be where you will see the numbers each day
"Edit" to pick your names

Just sitting around.


A heads up for you gas folks that Enron will be on ComEd's side against Dynegy on this power issue at
FERC, since EES designates Firm LD contracts as sources on ComEd's network transmission system (Dynegy wants ComEd to only allow "capacity" contracts to be used).  We plan to file the Enron response on Friday.

It sounds like I need to clafify my plans for trading and risk management of
power in Ontario.

1.  Garrett is in Toronto and should be doing everything possible to try to
understand all the ins and outs of the Ontario Power Market including
building forward curves.  He has dual reporting to Paul Devries (head of the
Enron's Toronto operation) and Dana Davies (head of ENA power trading for the
Northeast U.S.).  Dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for
Ontario.

2.  My current opinion is that we should trade Ontario out of the Toronto
office with risk management responsibilities rolling into Dana.  This could
always change in the future if it doesn't make sense.

3.  John Mckay, although he has been helping Bill out, will ultimately have
no power trading responsibilities.

4.  Tom May is the cash trader in N.Y. reporting to Dana.  I expect us to use
Tom's expertise with respect to Ontario to build up our competency there,
however, Toms' main role will be N.Y.

5.  Garrett should spend some time (probably soon) in Houston getting to know
the people and the technical resources available to him.

If anyone has any questions concerns please give me a call.

John

Password Deletion

It has been noted that many users have passwords which match or are similar
to their User ID's for internal EnronOnline applications (Stack Manager,
Product Manager, EOL Reports).

This is a significant security concern. Therefore, there will be a sweep of
ID's and passwords at the end of the day on Thursday, April 5. Any User ID's
which have passwords similar to the User ID will be subject to deletion.

Changing Your Password

Passwords can be changed in either the Stack Manager or in EOL Reports.

To change your password in the Stack Manager, once logged on, go to toolbar &
select "Help" and then select "Change Password".
The system will request you to enter your NEW password twice.

To change your passsword in EOL Reports, open the Reports application, log
in, select "Options" and "Change Password".The system will request you to
enter your NEW password twice. Please note that the password change
functionality within the Reports application is new. If it does not appear on
your menu and you are running on a standalone machine, you will need to
logout at the windows level and then login again to receive the updated
version.

If you have any questions, please call the EnronOnline Help Desk (Houston:
713 853 4357,  London: + 44 20 7783 7783)

Thank you for your assistance in preserving appropriate security.

I will be on vacation the week of July 17th through July 21st.  If you have
any risk questions, please refer them to  Dave Baumbach. If you need to get
in touch with me you can try my cell phone (713) 504-2666 or (850) 267-4300.


A number of parties protested Entergy's Source and Sink filing at FERC based
on arguments similar to ours (discriminatory treatment of PTP
customers/Generation only control areas approved by NERC).  As you can see,
TDUs and utilities joined in on this.:

Dynegy Power Marketing
Aquila Energy Marketing
Peco Energy Co.
Municipal Energy Agency of Miss.; Lafayette Utilities System; and the
Lousiana Energy and Power Authority (who pointed out that Entergy's proposal
could,  perhaps, only work in a big, regional system and that Entergy had
left SPP)
Coral Power, ELCON and Enron
VEPCO (who now owns an approved generation only control connected to Entergy
and TVA.  VEPCO alerts FERC that Entergy already refused transmission with
a sink at the new control area, even though Entergy asks for a May 22
effective date.)
Louisiana Energy Users Group
Tenaska Power Services
El Paso Merchant Energy (asks FERC to promote gen. only control areas as
"hubs" in order to move more toward the gas model)

Finally, ComEd filed comments stating this is an important issue and FERC
should resolve this before the summer.  ComEd did not take a position on
whether Entergy's filing was good or bad.  Maybe ComEd's filing will get FERC
to deny Entergy's request before the summer, rather than setting it for
hearing!  (There so far are no filings in support of Entergy.)

Let me know if you would like a copy of any of these.


I will be on vacation until July 9th. If you need to talk to me, try 605-272-5680. If no answer, try 605-272-5296. Cell phones and pagers don't work too good up there. I will be checking my voice and e:mails in the evenings, probably after 10:00 pm. sj


It appears that Shelley will not be flying back to the states until January 4th.  It doesn't look like she will be celebrating New Year's eve in Texas, but, I'm sure it will be one that she will remember for the rest of her life...

Subject: Access Card Information

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available.

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South ,
The Sky Ring
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.
To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.
Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:
Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week
Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:
Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems
Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.
Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.
Next steps
Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.
Summary
This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.
If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).


As a follow up to our meeting yesterday, here is a proposed timeline for the simulation which is scheduled for Thursday February 7th between 9:00 am and 11:00 am (Houston time):

Monday February 4th:
Complete preparation of Simulation Events and scripts

Tuesday February 5th:
Credit will provide a list of priority counterparties (anticipated to be approved for launch date)
Online Operations activates all counterparties on priority list in database and inactivates all other counterparties
Credit uses Profile Manager to provide profiles for approved counterparties
RAC inputs Sigma Factors into the database for all active Product Types
Online Operations will issue new application and website User ID's and Passwords to Traders
Online Operations confirms Product Types and Products are in the database
Online Operations confirms Online Contracts are in the database

Wednesday February 6th
Online Operations completes desktop check-ups for all application and website user
Traders access applications and review products and stack relationships
Counterparty User ID's and Passwords will be issued to role players
Credit rolls headroom into online database (evening)
Online Operations confirms database is set to Simulation scripts

When I remember to put a new book oif checks in my purse, do you want me to
make it out to you or give you cash!


Enron has two mobile units that are available for placement in customer deals or in pure merchant sites.  These are 22MW, trailer-mounted and are being refurbished/packaged for delivery QIII, 2001.  In general, these units will be high heat rate, high emissions, but are cheap and available.

In order to streamline the process and facilitate information flow, I have asked Jim Buerkle to be responsible for placing these machines into income producing deals in the WSCC.  He will evaluate site alternatives, work with the Enron groups that control these machines and structure the commercial deals.  Please forward any opportunities to Jim.  If these units get placed profitably, we will likely step up to manufacture more units available for Summer 2002.

Chris

Attached is a proposed test plan from HoustonStreet for tomorrow.  I have reserved conference room 2712 beginning at 2:30 tomorrow and will escort HoustonStreet onto our floor at 2:30 tomorrow.  They will be allowed to set up machines from 2:30 to 3:00.  At 3:00 we will allow HoustonStreet to discuss their plan prior to our review.

Enron has terminated the price posting agreement and has no obligation to do testing.  We have simply agreed to review their system.

During the review  anyone working with HoustonStreet should refrain from making any comments (positive or negative) concerning the performance of the system.  We will simply take the review under advisement.

All discussions with HoustonStreet should be handled by myself or Savita.

If you have any questions call me on 30397.

Larry is moving over to a Gas Controller position in Steve January's group.  Below, Steve mentions Larry's solid field experience. However, I would like to commend him on his ability to pick up the details associated with our monthly flash process, customer accounts meeting, and the various uploads necessary to help our monthly billing process run so smoothly.  Please stop by and wish Larry luck in his new job.
I am in the process of writing a job replacement justification requisition for Stan's approval and hope to replace his position within a few weeks.

how was the concert?


Cheryl,

Thanks for taking care of these so quickly.

I have reattached the central book request with some additional books.  The blue highlighted "Cent" books were on the original request but were labeled as "FB" and should have been PB as the book name.  I assume you did nothing with those books because there was no id next to it.  Is that correct?
I corrected them and also added two new books at the bottom.

Thanks again,

Girl, you know he's lying.  He's a trip, but it was a good sermon.


Jeff -- The region of MAIN sent a letter to NERC asking that the NERC
Security Comm. make a new interpretation about reserving ATC and scheduling
to a generation control area (since we will have the new Enron control area
in MAIN within 2 weeks).  MAIN is trying to prohibit us from using our new
control area as a source or sink.  Attached is Enron's response to NERC and
Howard Hawks asking the PITF to tell MAIN that this issue has already been
decided in last year's win over TVA.  A copy of MAIN's letter to NERC is

I just got back from the eye doctor.  My eye wasn't scratched.  I had a rusty piece of metal in it!  I tore down my garden (which is framed and covered in chicken wire to keep out the critters) on Sunday and a piece of the wire must have lodged in my eye.  I will spare you the gross details of him using a needle to dig this rusty piece of metal out of my eye like a splinter...  It was numb and still hurt.  I won't be in this afternoon.

The View/Accept Contract screen will contain text cut which is currently in

when received from Haakon).

Note that we are planning on using the same template as represented by the

I know I have been absent from the 2 regularly scheduled meetings on Friday am for the last 2 weeks and it is not going to get a lot better for the next 2 weeks either.   For this I apologize, but I am trying to understand the new expanded world to determine any potential points of integration, if any.    I am going to have Kathy see if there is a time earlier in the week that we might be able to use for direct reports and administrative matters and a separate time for Commercial support reviews.  Please keep the reports flowing  as this is currently my means of keeping up.     I would like for staff meetings to continue, even in my absence for the next 2 weeks.

I am working on some organizational changes, which I am not quite ready to discuss, but they should not impact the majority of you at all.     I will not be replacing me in my old position in ETS, but will be expanding the crew to include the worlds of EGAS, Wind, Azurix, EEOS, Portland (they will be here for most of the next year) etc.     In the meantime if you need to talk to me please have Kathy get you in to my schedule in person or via phone.    I am also in the office nearly everyday, other than tuesday (EOTT staff meetings), by 6:30 am.

Thane's daughter, Sarah, is in Texas Children's Hospital.  I spoke with Thane this afternoon, Sarah will have surgery tonight.  The surgery is exploratory in nature, as well as repair of her broken leg. She has been in a great deal of pain since last night.

This has been and continues to be a very difficult time for Thane and his wife, Linda. I sent a doll to Sarah, she is three years of age, from the American Girl Collection on behalf of governmental affairs.  Jean


I asked everyone for their A/A needs and received very little feedback.  Please respond promptly.


Thanks

The original 12/2001 recap sent out had an error which effected previous months plus December UAF numbers.  The problem occurred when a station was accidentally removed from the pipeline balance setup within PGAS.  The attached Recap has been corrected to include this meter and 2001 UAF does NOT look good for NNG.

Current NNG UAF:
December:	-0.81%		-1,023,077 DTH
Year to Date:	-0.39%		-5,155,854 DTH

This makes 8 months in a row of high UAF loss for NNG.

Please try to attend today's UAF to discuss this issue and help put together an action plan to locate and correct problems.


Today's Agenda:


I am talking to GFI for North America.  GFI originally called us concerning Europe but backed down and didnt want to pay. I will ask again if they want Europe.
Natsource Europe is in contract discussions with us for Europe and UK Gas and Power.  They asked us to throw in coal and the coal group said no.  I have tried to get them to change their position as this will add liquidity.  Ask them why they do not want Natsource. They pay nothing for executions by Natsource.
TFS has not been contacted concerning Europe.  Feel free to contact them and try to get a deal.  Call me to discuss.

Attached is a FERC proforma tariff.  However, each transmission provider will have its own version approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and it could contain substantial changes.  Also, the ISO tariffs are quite different and have numerous other rules.


I will not be in today. I am not feeling well - sinus drainage, sore throat, body aches.  If you need me, you can reach me at home at (281) 359-6258.  I will follow up with my group to make sure I have everything covered for today and prepared for tomorrow's Customer Accounts Meetings.

Hi all,
I have made modifications on the model as requested.  It now handles different
volatility curves as well as 4 different hour blocks.

See the notice below regarding the next PJM Energy Market Committee (EMC) meeting on Nov 8. I will be on jury duty that day and will be unable to cover the meeting.  The  EMC is the most active (and activist) committee in PJM where most issues and changes to market rules and the tariff are proposed and debated (an agenda has yet to be issued).  I would suggest that we provide coverage of this meeting either in person or conference call.  If you are interested in attending or participating via conference call let me know.

Thanks Joe and Sherry. I am also sending this to Jo Williams for consideration. sj

As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.

Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.

My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.

In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.

Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".

If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.

Lavo and Louise - This could be the "Alberta PPA" for 2002.   Lots of "hair" but lots of upside.

Any thoughts?


fyi

As a result of a smooth launch and market demand, we are accelerating the
timetable for the launch of several EnronOnline products.

Specifically,  after the launch of U.S. power on Monday, Dec. 13th, we will
be launching the following:

Wednesday, December 15: US Coal, U.S. Plastics, US Pulp and Paper
Thursday, December 16: Norwegian Power

Although the legal review has been completed for all of the above, I would
appreciate it if you would look once more at the products which are relevant
to your area and confirm that you are happy with them (some of you are
already in the process of doing so - thank you)

We absolutely want to avoid making changes after launch due to the problems
associated with changing descriptions on products which have already traded.

The Product Long Descriptions can be seen in the Product Manager by expanding
the Product Type in the tree to show each of the dependent Products, then
right-clicking the Product, selecting View and then pressing the View
Description button which appears on the pop-up window.

Please contact myself or Dale Neuner if you have any comments.

Thanks,

Dave

As our business continues to grow and change, Energy Operations is challenged
daily to ensure best practices throughout all services provided.  We recently
decided to consolidate the Risk Management, Deal Validation and Operational
Analysis functions into one group, directed under the management of a
Business Controller.  I am pleased to announce that Steve Venturatos has
accepted the role of Business Controller for Texas/Upstream Operations,
reporting to me.  Additionally, Dave Baumbach has agreed to serve as the Lead
of the group.  Other additions to the group include Jody Crook, a first year
analyst, and Ami Chokshi.  Ami will continue to serve as the account manager
for both Entex and TUFCO.  The attached oranizational chart identifies all
team members.  Additionally, the Denver trading books will be transitioned
from Will Kelly (who is assuming the Business Controller role for the East
region) to our group.  We will also be working with Keith McIver and John
Peyton to establish risk books for the drilling day rate trading anticipated
to kick off soon.

Mike Eiben has assumed responsiblities previously managed by Steve Venturatos
which include Global Contracts and Facilities, System Enhancements and
Regulatory Reporting.  Clem Cernosek will be joining the Logistics team in a
trouble shooting capacity.  Jennifer Pattison will be joining Volume
Management, focused on trouble shooting and UA4.  Both Clem and Jennifer have
been on the Unify - POPS team.

Please join me in sharing this information with pertinent staff members, and
in wishing each of these employees success in thier new roles.


The first group of trading contracts will go out to 77 companies for a total of 168 counterparties (most companies have multiple entities).  This group obviously does not include everyone, but we have most of our major relationships (and it is the official list that has been submitted to UBS for credit approval.)

The general marketing plan is as follows:
- Contact all customers this week to tell them about UBS Warburg Energy
- Get contract/PA packages in front of First Priority counterparties this week
- Arrange meetings or follow-up calls as appropriate
- Dave Forster and the ubswenergy.com team will be sending out online PA packages to all parties later this week (so it is important to have contacted all customers)
- Once the initial wave of contracts is out and review/negotiations are uderway, we will submit a Second Priority list for credit approval

The attached file has all of the First Priority counterparties, along with names for gas, power, online, credit and legal.   Apologies for the imperfect information - it came from several different sources.  In addition, we have columns for describing the type of agreement and its status (not pursuing, incomplete, done).  Please complete and/or edit the attached and forward to either Debra Bailey or Lloyd Will.  If you think you should take the lead on a particular counterparty, call up the other person and work it out!  Progress on this effort will be reviewed during our twice-weekly calls.


Fine.

Okay, I'll send it via the mail.  I like your new hair style, it looks good!


On Monday, Enron filed these responses to MISO filings at FERC:

-- Protested MISO's proposed $1000 penalty on accepted requests that are subsequently withdrawn by the customer
-- Protested another in the string of MISO proposed changes to its OATT for 12/15/01 start date:  for example, MISO included additional scheduling penalties and removed the ability to settle losses financially
--Commented on MISO's proposed market monitor plan

The pleadings are attached below.


You go girl, you're in my prayers!


I really appreciate your assistance in reviewing the NNG contract files, pulling out and making copies of all letter agreements for our most recent data request from Dynegy.  I understand the coordination this required and the tight time constraint that you worked under (during bid week and the preliminary reservation billing cycle) and am pleased with your sense of urgency.

Thank you for the effort and, as a result, now have complete binders of all letter agreements that are in Houston.  When I am in Omaha on Wednesday, I will ask Dari if she has any letter agreements in her office that may not have been forwarded on to Houston.  If she does, I will make sure we receive copies of these agreements.

Shelley,  Tim is looking into these balances.  Tejas has an imbalance we're checking into that developed in December for 211K.  It appears estimates were used for actual flow & we don't have a lot of confidence that that much gas actually flowed.  Mike Wagner tells me the check meter is not working and he has had no luck getting anyone to fix it.  Tim is following up w/Tejas to find out what the actual flow for Dec was.  Also, we're currently working trying to take some of the balances in payback to cover FPL working off their imbalance during the outages we have in process.  We're implementing a process with the team to ensure scheduled quantites are tied out each month so Tim & Cynthia can concentrate on actual flow volumes and reconciliation of any old unreconciled imbalances.

Many of you currently use iBuyit eProcurement to purchase IT hardware, and others will begin to use the tool on July 2, 2001, to purchase office supplies.  iBuyit eProcurement will automatically route purchase requests for approval based on our spend/approval guidelines.


If you have any questions regarding these guidelines, please contact Tammy R. Shepperd at 713-853-6589.

Thank you for your continued commitment to a strategic approach to spending.

Ricki,  would you please forward this message to the NNG & TW teams.

Last Thursday evening, Mary Lou was in a car accident and was bumped around pretty good.  She was taken to the hospital, but sent home that evening w/cuts and bruises.  The following morning, one of the doctors at the hospital called to ask her to return to the hospital for another MRI as they suspicion a brain aneurysm, which was nothing to do with the accident.  Friday evening, Mary Lou called to tell me she does in fact have a very small aneurysm, and she is to go to a neurologist today, Monday.  Either Mary Lou or one of her children will call me later today with another update, which I will forward on as soon as I am notified.  Sheila

I have asked the crude group to give a presentation on fuel oil supply and
demand which will take place Wednesday July 12 at 2:15 in the big boardroom
on the 30th floor. I would encourage everyone to come and bring any traders
that you think would benefit from it.


Hi,

Welcome back, I trust you had a good vacation.Nothing much going on here,
just huge price moves.

Anyway, everything we well, for the most part.  As far as Alliance gas is
concerned, the only new information is that the Aux Sable commissioning
process will not start until Wednesday (last estimate) per Anne Buschal.  So
make sure to mention to Hunter on Monday, as everyone else should already
know about it.  Anne's number is 403-517-6270.  She will be calling each
Morning.

My logon and password is: pmims and louise8mom.  Please look at the Nigas
Troy Grove Sheet that I have on my computer.

My position should be around 15 long, just enough to cover rolloff for 2
days.  If its not, please buy/sell to get me close to that number (or
whatever is best depending on which way the market is going).


P.S. I'm selling to Clark Refining at the Illini Point, 4,000/day @ Sitara #
436296.  He wants us to keep them on until he calls to tell us otherwise.
His number is 314-854-9644 Dteve Brown.

I'll be back on Wednesday.


Attached are the responses to the questions of FERC staff about EOL resulting from their visit earlier this month.  I have used the revisions from Louise and incorporated comments from Bob Butts about the value at risk discussion.  Mark Haedicke has reviewed this draft.  I would like to send these to Kim Bruno at FERC later today.

An additional FYI.  Connie Lausten of the U.S. House Government Reform Committee made a request to Enron's DC office to see the trading floor operations in addition to holding a discussion about Enron Online.  She is to meet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am.  John Shelk from our DC office told me when people on the Hill say "Enron OnLine" they mean not only the online trading platform itself, but the broader subject of financial products and energy  trading, whether online or otherwise.  John said that the interest coming from the Hill is broader than the platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of understanding of the benefits of what we do in this area.  We will be coordinating this with the DC office.

Please call me with any comments at 37007.


I plan on being out this Friday, Feb. 8th, and will be out of town until Sunday evening. I will have my cell phone and pager. thanks. sj


As discussed in the California conference call this morning, I have prepared
a bullet-point summary of the CERA Special Report titled Beyond the
California Power Crisis: Impact, Solutions, and Lessons.If you have any
questions, my phone number is 713 853-3170.


Attached are the revised files.  I understand that you will provide this to
Shankman.  Please let me know if you need anything else from me or if I can
help explain it to Jeff.

Legal folks -- please let me know of any other legal people who should be
added to interconnection issue emails.
On May 16, FERC clarified its policy regarding credits for network upgrades
associated with the interconnection of a generating facility -- all network
upgrade costs (the cost of all facilities from the point where the generator
connects to the grid), including those necessary to remedy short-circuit and
stability problems, should be credited back to the customer that funded the
upgrades once the delivery service begins.
Once a customer signs up for transmission, then the transmission provider is
limited to charging the higher of the expansion cost or an embedded cost rate.
Generally, Enron has not procured transmission at the time of interconnection
and therefore, may be required to pay the network upgrades at the time of
interconnection; however, the order clarifies that a credit should be
available to the interconnecting customer or a third party that contracts for
transmission away from the generator.
