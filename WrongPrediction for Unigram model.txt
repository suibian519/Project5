Thanks,


Hi all.  Stacy and I have finally moved to 16.  Since so many people were out or swamped this week, I didn't get to say a proper goodbye so thought I would write one.  I enjoyed being your neighbor and already miss all of you.

Have a Happy Thanksgiving!

The 3 FERC staffers will be at Dynegy next Tues to observe power and gas
traders starting at 7 am.  They will then have a presentation from Dynegy's

While at Enron Monday afternoon, we will probably have them sit with both
Kevin (power) and Phillip (gas) after Dave's presentation.

user-specified period of time. It also allows user to enter their estimate of ISO
curtailment on their generation capacity by month in "Asset" page.

EnronOnline/NetCoOnline status update:
- "NetCoOnline" will be distinct from EnronOnline, with much the same functionality and a refreshed look.
- We will carry data to support the same gas and power products as were on EnronOnline. Please contact us if you will need different products from what was on EnronOnline.
- We have prepared a list of top customers in CDN and US Gas and Power (copy attached), which we will be using as a guide in chasing signed Password Applications.
- To speed the registration process, top customers will be preloaded into the system for activation as soon as we receive their Password Application.
- We are intending to use a simple, online GTC, which can be superceded by a negotiated Master Agreement, as with EnronOnline.
- Internal trader names have been circulated to each desk head for approval.

Hey Sugar Bear!


I was just thinking about you and was hoping that everything is going okay
for you.  I constantly keep you in prayer regarding your situation.   How's
Erika doing?

You missed church Sunday when they forceably removed one of the guys (aaron
Burr) from the church.  You remember he was the one that used to sit on the
front row and get happy alllllllllll the time.  You remember him, anyway they
hauled his tail out of there.  It was terrible to see someone hauled from the
church, not matter what the situation is.

Oh well, take care, and call me if we need to talk!!!!


I would like to get you all set up with the RAC website (icon above).  This will enable you to see your daily VaR, drill down to VaR by risk type, by month and run VaR scenarios.

This is where we pull in our information for the VaR report we publish each morning, and with this you won't have to wait for us to publish before you can see the numbers.

Everyone has been granted access to the east desk VaR and some of you are already set up with your defaults on the website.

For those who aren't................

Copy this icon to your desktop
Once you enter the site (rac.enron.com) click on "Market Details" on the bottom of the list on the left
The top left box (VaR) will be where you will see the numbers each day
"Edit" to pick your names

below are the names listed for the east desk (this will show you the total east var and break it down by trader)...identical to what we have been publishing

S_NEAL
C_AMES
BRAWNER
C_GERMANY
J_HODGE
J_HODGE-VNG
P_KEAVEY
B_MCKAY
J_MCKAY2
S_PEREIRA
V_PIMENOV

Once everyone is set up we will stop publishing the VAR in the morning.

Please ask me or your book admin. if you have any questions.

Thanks

I plan on taking vacation October 4, 5, 8,9 10, 11, and 12. This will finish my vacation for the year. thanks. sj


A heads up for you gas folks that Enron will be on ComEd's side against Dynegy on this power issue at
FERC, since EES designates Firm LD contracts as sources on ComEd's network transmission system (Dynegy wants ComEd to only allow "capacity" contracts to be used).  We plan to file the Enron response on Friday.

Thank you Victor.  I deleted the demand charges on the duplicate deal, #139693.

Password Deletion

It has been noted that many users have passwords which match or are similar
to their User ID's for internal EnronOnline applications (Stack Manager,
Product Manager, EOL Reports).

This is a significant security concern. Therefore, there will be a sweep of
ID's and passwords at the end of the day on Thursday, April 5. Any User ID's
which have passwords similar to the User ID will be subject to deletion.

Changing Your Password

Passwords can be changed in either the Stack Manager or in EOL Reports.

To change your password in the Stack Manager, once logged on, go to toolbar &
select "Help" and then select "Change Password".
The system will request you to enter your NEW password twice.

To change your passsword in EOL Reports, open the Reports application, log
in, select "Options" and "Change Password".The system will request you to
enter your NEW password twice. Please note that the password change
functionality within the Reports application is new. If it does not appear on
your menu and you are running on a standalone machine, you will need to
logout at the windows level and then login again to receive the updated
version.

If you have any questions, please call the EnronOnline Help Desk (Houston:
713 853 4357,  London: + 44 20 7783 7783)

Thank you for your assistance in preserving appropriate security.

-----Original Appointment-----


Louise,
Cancellation charges have been the focus because the cash is provided by e-Next banks (turbopark).  The cash paid to date is less than the actual contractual obligation to date.  We do not need balance sheet cash to continue, but we need to come up with B/S cash if we terminate.  Hopefully the following clarifies:
Cash Payments to Date:
GE7FA		13,328
ST		909
HRSG		1480
Interest 	350
Total:		16,067
Next Payments:
GE7FA		1,566		Nov 21
ST		2,849		Dec 1
HRSG		2,960		Dec 1
These are estimates - the timing of the actual payments depends upon when the vendor completes some of the work - payment based on milestones
Cancellation Charges:
10/31:		$23MM
11/1:		$24MM
11/30:		$28.3MM
Each day from 11/1 to 11/30 the cancellation charge increases by approx $150K
DASH is based on contractual exposure, not cash out the door, hence the request at this time.  In addition to looking for opportunities to sell the equipment and the project, we are looking into the ST and HRSG contracts to make sure the vendors are not in any sort of breach.

Assistance

As always, if you have any problems with any EnronOnline functionality,
please contact the 24 hour Help Desk (Houston: 713 853 4357, London: +44 (0)
20 7783 7783, Australia: +61 2 9229 2300).


General Feedback

If you have any comments on the new functionality, or suggestions for further
functionality, please call David Forster on 713 853 1861. If you had
previously suggested new functionality which didn't make it into this
release, rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard
to improve all elements of EnronOnline and will try to incorporate your
requests into the next release of the EnronOnline Stack Manager.


FYI........

We will probably have some changes to the trader matrix, we have had some traders quit or decide to stay with the estate.  Once we know for sure, we will send you the new breakout.

Thanks,

Kam

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.
To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.
Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:
Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week
Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:
Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems
Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.
Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.
Next steps
Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.
Summary
This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.
If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).


As a follow up to our meeting yesterday, here is a proposed timeline for the simulation which is scheduled for Thursday February 7th between 9:00 am and 11:00 am (Houston time):

Monday February 4th:

Thank you very much for the nice gift (and, of course, the $1).   I appreciate you girls putting up with me and doing a great job for the whole floor.

Thanks again.


I plan to take a 1/2 day vacation on the afternoons of Thursday and Friday of this week.

Please complete Hayden's form for your respective regions.
Keep in mind that this could act as potential position limit set forth by UBS so be careful in completing this form.   In addition, UBS has a liquidity reserve used to adjust curves when marking P&L.    The "liquidity reserve" accounts for the fact you can't liquidate at the mid and with big positions you probably can't even liquidate at the bid (offer).
Thanks.

Larry is moving over to a Gas Controller position in Steve January's group.  Below, Steve mentions Larry's solid field experience. However, I would like to commend him on his ability to pick up the details associated with our monthly flash process, customer accounts meeting, and the various uploads necessary to help our monthly billing process run so smoothly.  Please stop by and wish Larry luck in his new job.
I am in the process of writing a job replacement justification requisition for Stan's approval and hope to replace his position within a few weeks.

Judy,

I thought I was through, but I'm not.....Can you please send up the the
following contracts:

Wisconsin Power & Light  96045691

WPS     96001003

Also, if someone in my group has already checked it out and returned to you,
just tell me who had it and I'll copy off of them (smile!!).

Also, do you have a copy of the GTC.  We have no idea what it is, and we're
looking for the non-performance language associated with it.

Girl, you know he's lying.  He's a trip, but it was a good sermon.


I just got back from the eye doctor.  My eye wasn't scratched.  I had a rusty piece of metal in it!  I tore down my garden (which is framed and covered in chicken wire to keep out the critters) on Sunday and a piece of the wire must have lodged in my eye.  I will spare you the gross details of him using a needle to dig this rusty piece of metal out of my eye like a splinter...  It was numb and still hurt.  I won't be in this afternoon.

Hey:
So I was thinking about your NY problem...I might have an answer.  The site
http://www.bestfares.com/internet_charts/hotel_internet.htm
lists cheap hotel specials.  The problem is they won't list them until the
Wednesday before the weekend.  Check it out though.  They have some
reasonable deals.

Attached is the new site map file for auctions. It has been modified to
reflect the ordering of the global nav and the removal of the ATA, which is
no longer needed.

The View/Accept Contract screen will contain text cut which is currently in
the About Storage Services section (I will modify the text file accordingly
when received from Haakon).

Note that we are planning on using the same template as represented by the
Market Info. screen in EnronOnline, although there will be a unique set of
graphics for each of:

1) The Auctions Home Page
2) All of the EnBank pages (which will share the same graphic treatment, with
appropriate title amendments).


There will be a desk head mtg tomorrow, Sunday, at 3:00 on the 33rd floor per Lavorato to discuss positions and strategy.  Please confirm via email.  My cell # is 713 557 3330 if there are any problems.

Ok


Please see attached.


I know I have been absent from the 2 regularly scheduled meetings on Friday am for the last 2 weeks and it is not going to get a lot better for the next 2 weeks either.   For this I apologize, but I am trying to understand the new expanded world to determine any potential points of integration, if any.    I am going to have Kathy see if there is a time earlier in the week that we might be able to use for direct reports and administrative matters and a separate time for Commercial support reviews.  Please keep the reports flowing  as this is currently my means of keeping up.     I would like for staff meetings to continue, even in my absence for the next 2 weeks.

I am working on some organizational changes, which I am not quite ready to discuss, but they should not impact the majority of you at all.     I will not be replacing me in my old position in ETS, but will be expanding the crew to include the worlds of EGAS, Wind, Azurix, EEOS, Portland (they will be here for most of the next year) etc.     In the meantime if you need to talk to me please have Kathy get you in to my schedule in person or via phone.    I am also in the office nearly everyday, other than tuesday (EOTT staff meetings), by 6:30 am.

Thane's daughter, Sarah, is in Texas Children's Hospital.  I spoke with Thane this afternoon, Sarah will have surgery tonight.  The surgery is exploratory in nature, as well as repair of her broken leg. She has been in a great deal of pain since last night.

This has been and continues to be a very difficult time for Thane and his wife, Linda. I sent a doll to Sarah, she is three years of age, from the American Girl Collection on behalf of governmental affairs.  Jean

The original 12/2001 recap sent out had an error which effected previous months plus December UAF numbers.  The problem occurred when a station was accidentally removed from the pipeline balance setup within PGAS.  The attached Recap has been corrected to include this meter and 2001 UAF does NOT look good for NNG.

Current NNG UAF:
December:	-0.81%		-1,023,077 DTH
Year to Date:	-0.39%		-5,155,854 DTH

This makes 8 months in a row of high UAF loss for NNG.

Please try to attend today's UAF to discuss this issue and help put together an action plan to locate and correct problems.

See the notice below regarding the next PJM Energy Market Committee (EMC) meeting on Nov 8. I will be on jury duty that day and will be unable to cover the meeting.  The  EMC is the most active (and activist) committee in PJM where most issues and changes to market rules and the tariff are proposed and debated (an agenda has yet to be issued).  I would suggest that we provide coverage of this meeting either in person or conference call.  If you are interested in attending or participating via conference call let me know.

You go girl, you're in my prayers!


I really appreciate your assistance in reviewing the NNG contract files, pulling out and making copies of all letter agreements for our most recent data request from Dynegy.  I understand the coordination this required and the tight time constraint that you worked under (during bid week and the preliminary reservation billing cycle) and am pleased with your sense of urgency.

Thank you for the effort and, as a result, now have complete binders of all letter agreements that are in Houston.  When I am in Omaha on Wednesday, I will ask Dari if she has any letter agreements in her office that may not have been forwarded on to Houston.  If she does, I will make sure we receive copies of these agreements.

Ricki,  would you please forward this message to the NNG & TW teams.

Last Thursday evening, Mary Lou was in a car accident and was bumped around pretty good.  She was taken to the hospital, but sent home that evening w/cuts and bruises.  The following morning, one of the doctors at the hospital called to ask her to return to the hospital for another MRI as they suspicion a brain aneurysm, which was nothing to do with the accident.  Friday evening, Mary Lou called to tell me she does in fact have a very small aneurysm, and she is to go to a neurologist today, Monday.  Either Mary Lou or one of her children will call me later today with another update, which I will forward on as soon as I am notified.  Sheila
