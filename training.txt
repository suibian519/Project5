In order to prepare a paper for my graduate class on Leadership, I would like to interview you as a leader. Some questions that would be of interest would be what events conspired to bring you to Enron, what developmental process you knowingly (or unknowingly) went through in your early years and what challenges have you encountered that made a significant change in your career.

If you would be amenable and have the time, I would like to interview you sometime next week for about 30-40 minutes. If you wish, I could provide you questions in advance to maximize your time.

Thank you for considering this request.

John,

I met with Ben regarding the Precedent Agreement this evening.  He had the
following questions/comments:

1. "...Shipper's power plant construction by August 1, 2001, then either
Party may terminate this Precedent Agreement by providing the other Party
written notice of such termination.  ; provided that such right to terminate
must be exercised on or before August 3, 2001.  In any event, unless the
Shipper provides written notice to Transco on or before August 3, 2001 that
it will enter into a Service Agreement , the Precedent Agreement will
terminate automatically.

2. Can we make the Guaranty effective after August 3, 2001 if we do not
terminate the Precedent Agreement?

3. In talking to Gerald Nemec, it also occurred to me that we need to
determine any balance sheet effects of the Guaranty in relationship to this
project.  I will check on this tomorrow and let you know.


Thanks.

Attached is a DPC press release that we would like to issue in India on Saturday morning their time.  Due to coverage of related issues, this timing is important.  We have been advised that these facts need to be disseminated to be responsive to the judge's remarks and before the Mumbai High Court  hearing scheduled for next week.

The DPC press release is significantly more detailed than normal Enron practice, but is deliberately styled to be appropriate for an Indian audience.  In fact, we anticipate that a number of Indian publications will run the release verbatim.  Of course, this will likely result in international coverage, as well.  Any comments would be appreciated.

I agree with the concept as it adds a degree of clarity.  We are however moving towards a fixed fee approach with the service providers in the organisation as I found I was spending too much time validating the 'controllables' which I think under your scenario would be monitoring the RCs.  So essentially, we (EA) will be paying a fixed transaction fee to the Energy Operations and IT functions which will be embodied in a contract, I will know my costs and nothing can just be allocated to me.
The method of arriving at a number will be using historical numbers versus a growth projection for the number of transactions, I believe this will work for new businesses too.
This method allows me to concentrate on Enron Americas whilst not incurring large allocated charges which I spend time investigating.

**START**
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic  arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.

Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond continues to respectively run the West Gas and the Texas Gas Origination Groups.

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Here is the story...November production..we purchased $3.1 MM of gas and sold $3.9 MM.  On December 31, MGI paid us the gross amount. According to Jaime, we have no formal netting agreement nor have we ever netted in the past.  MGI assumed that once they paid the 3.9 we would pay the 3.1.  We did not.  Post-petition payment but pre-petition contract.  We do not have a master, and I assume we confirmed using GTCs; Jaime did indicate that the volumes were comprised of several deals.  He wants to know if he is going to get paid.  I did not want to comment and told him that I would pass to you and gave him your name.  Does he have a pre-petition or administrative claim?  He spoke to someone in settlements and told me that person (did not have name) indicated they could not pay him because of the bankruptcy. Jamie's number is below.

EPA and TVA have been negotiating for some time over possible settlements in
enforcement actions filed by EPA over modifications made to TVA power plants
in violation of New Source Review (NSR) rules.  Those negotiations to reach
an out-of-court solution have officially broken down, with TVA filing a
petition in federal court late yesterday opposing EPA's NSR enforcement
allegations.

While many felt TVA might settle with EPA (since it was government
negotiating with government), TVA has taken a very strong stance, indicating
that they made some offers to EPA but that EPA's unreasonable stance would
cause severe harm to grid reliability, the financial viability of TVA and
pocketbooks of the ratepayers.   Southern Company and Duke Energy filed
petitions supporting TVA.

EPA is insisting that these court filings will in no way stop the Agency from
pursuing NSR enforcement measures.

I will keep you posted as to any developments in negotiations or court
actions in this area.

that this Power Product will be managed by the Weather Desk, it is different
in that it more closely mirrors a Weather transaction, as Weather trading
will be adjusting the 'Strike Prices' (as opposed to the proces) for these
power transactions through the Bid and Offer. The Pay Unit is set at 10/MW
and the Floating Price will equal PJM Demand prices on the PJMs official
website. The Payment Amount will equal the product of the Notional and the

Mr Skilling,

I would like the opportunity to talk to you at some point to discuss your vision and goals for the Broadband
Operating System (BOS), and strategic development in general in Enron/EBS.


Since EBS is currently focused almost exclusively on short-term tactical delivery  (which it should be), I'm not
sure how strategic efforts like the BOS fits into those goals.   Balancing these tactical vs. strategic goals is
becoming _very_ difficult.  Indeed, because of the current customer-specific tactical deliverables, there is
very little strategic development going on in general in EBS.  Yet I know that BOS is still a very important
deliverable.

I want to make sure we're doing everything we need to do to support your goals and vision for EBS.

It would _really_ help me if I could hear a little bit more about your short/med/long term goals for the BOS,
and perhaps some of your thoughts about EBS' technology and products in general.  Then we could discuss
ways to properly balance the tactical and strategic efforts to achieve those goals.


---


On a different topic, I understand that you are currently thinking about potential projects for the Xcelerator.
And I understand that you are focusing on technical products and capabilities that do not overlap the current
& past initiatives at other business units.  I think that there are many great opportunities in that approach.

I have seen a number of very interesting product concepts from various people in Enron that
would fit that model perfectly.  And I'm sure there are many many more.   As a sample, I've attached
a short document  listing just a few of the technology-focused ideas that I have heard about.

I also included the idea of commercializing BOS as a stand-alone product on that list.  Perhaps this is
one way that BOS could continue developing within Enron without interfering with the current tactical focus.
Obviously, EBS would still be the primary customer for BOS no matter how it is developed.

....just a thought....


Thank you for your time.

Request for new portfolios (books) after close.  Drafting procedures.

Request for new employee security.

Request to change curve mapping in ERMS/CPS.  Drafting procedures.

Also, it appears the IT service agreement may have to be amended to cover the
Web pages used to push operational data to customers (If AEP wants to continue
the service) and the Tariff filing system we just put into production.

Also, we will need to resolve how we handle counterparties that Enron credit has request we suspend trading when

Attached is the updated EJ deal pipeline report following Joe's note below. This is updated daily by the Originators here, so excuse some rough edges. I believe we've made good progress in our 1st Qtr in EGM; progress on accessing a diverse universe of target EGM customers, identifying customer needs, building a deal list, advancing / closing out documentation, developing RAC's understanding of our business and now quoting firm prices. This report + the traction we're beginning to achieve in the market here supports the budget numbers you discussed with Joe earlier today.

To reflect the Sato initiative which we're running independently of the Origination focus,  separate pages reflecting this have been added.

The Federal Appeals Court ruling in the litigation over the EPA's Section 126
NOx Rule was just released.  From a quick scan it looks like the  court
mostly upheld the EPA positions, and the Rule will go forward as planned
(impelmentation May 2003).

However, there are a few things remanded to the EPA for review and it's
possible this along with the delay associated with these remands could cause
a delay in implementation.  I'm also picking up from EPA sources that there
may be an effort underway to examine EPA's legal options for synchronizing
the 126 and NOx SIP implementation dates to summer 2004.

I am reviewing the ruling in more detail and will have more detailed analysis
to you shortly.

Jeff,

I was disappointed to learn of Philippe's departure from Enron.  I have been continually impressed with his accomplishments and more importantly, at his extensive knowledge of Enron's business and priorities.

I would like to submit my name for consideration as a replacement for the position of CTO at Enron Networks.  I realize the importance of the role that I fulfill with Enron Broadband and understand how difficult it would be at this time for me to leave EBS; however I could not allow this opportunity to pass without expressing my interest.  I am sure that a suitable solution could be formulated if it was determined that I would be the right fit for the CTO role.

I appreciate your consideration, and will make myself available if you would like to discuss my qualifications.

Respectively,

You have two cows.  You sell three of them to your publically listed company using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank.
Then, you execute a debt-equity swap with an associated general officer, so you get all four cows back, with a tax-exemption for the fifth cow, of course.
The rights to the estimated future value of the milk cash flow stream of the six cows are monetized and transferred via an intermediary to the Caymen Islands, secretly owned by a majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company, off-balance sheet, of course.
The annual report says the company owns eight cows and recognizes milk revenue for the 20 year life of the cows.
This is hedged with derivative cow life insurance policy through a Caymen Island bank, and these hedges are arranged through EnronOnline's commodity storefront with an option to buy one more cow, no balance sheet provided.....
The company says it will file all footnotes at a later date.

Mark and Jeff,
The Paper & Pulp desk has a customer that they would like to put into a three
year financial deal; however, the credit profile of the customer would
require hefty upfront security.  At the same time, they would like to enter
into a contract wherein ENA purchases all of their production (newsprint) at
index prices.  ENA's payable to this company could run to 10MM/ month.  Can
we draft a netting arrangement that would allow us to net the physical and
financial exposures in the event of a default so that the customer would not
be required to post security for the financial deal?  I think we may have
done something along these lines for a couple of Fred Lagrasta's customers.
I am comfortable that the purchase payable will more than offset the
potential financial exposure, but want to ensure that you are comfortable
that the ability to net these two exposures can be assured through a
contract.  Let me know your thoughts.

I've been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest
by Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating
that the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we
should be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will
need to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if
our number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but
I think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say,
2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe.
The group's thoughts on this would be appreciated.
Thanks.

Angela, if in your view, the issues brought up by Chase are an underlying dissatisfaction with the "entire" agreement, particularily the commodity "savings and advice" component, perhaps it would be advantageous for both Enron and Chase to sit down and re-negotiate.  From our point of view, given the execution and contract issues we currently have with the contract, this may be a win-win for the companies.  Let's sit down and discuss strategy - if you think it would be advantageous, I will replace Tom as senior level contact.

As per my voice mail from this weekend, I would like to get ahead of the potential issues brewing at a number of the other accounts particularily Starwood.

Good Morning!

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Sat 	11/17	47 Bcfd
Sun	11/18	52 Bcfd

Enron will have a table of 10 at the Trustee Opening Gala Dinner on May 16th,
with cocktails at 7pm and a seated dinner at 8:30pm.  The Gala starts with a
private viewing of the exhibition, followed by a seated dinner for 280 people
in the Rotunda of the museum. Attendees are comprised of Trustees, government

Several business unit executives are using this forum to take potential
customers and we would like to know if you are interested in attending.

To all Energy Operations employees:
ENA has experienced extraordinary growth thus far in 2000.  I am especially
proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth.
I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that
you have demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you
for that.
Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA
and Energy Operations this year.  Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make
sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and
that any barriers that may impede your work are removed.
To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen
Corporation -- to survey our organization; to "take its pulse" if you will;
to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we
could improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the "necessary tools"
and breaking down any "barriers."  SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants
who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this.  SJBC will
meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight
our successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments,
and the like.  This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the
goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.
Specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that
input.
Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC
consultant.  Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest
opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we
cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it
will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not
received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts
with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and
Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.
Communication is one of Enron's core values.  I want to stress that only
through open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.
Thank you.

While there are certainly pros and cons both ways, I agree with Jim to lead
with the market structure issues.  This was the focus of FERC's order and we
perhaps overemphasize the refund issue by elevating it to number 1.  Plus, we
lose a little credibility since, like the UDCs, we would come across as, at
bottom, primiarily concerned only with maximizing our financial position, and
less concerned with trying to be a constructive force in shaping a
competitive market in California.  That is not FERC's priority.  Finally, and
I say this will great equivocation, I believe that FERC carefully drafted the
refund language, that it knew exactly what it was doing, and is unlikely to
move off that formulation either way.  The issue is still of utmost
importance but for the foregoing reasons as well as those stated by Jim, I
would prioritize it just below the $150 soft cap and prospective refund
issue.  Ron

<James.D.Steffes@enron.com> 11/22/00 10:30AM >>>

As I've been thinking about our response today, I would like Enron to focus
on making sure that the California (WSCC) markets are as good a possible for
business over the next 15 to 24 months.  Following that idea, I think that
the key points are (1) clarifying/raising the soft cap and (2) reducing the
burden/risk of the prospective refund period.
I know that we had discussed leading off with the debate over market power /
retroactive refunds, but I think that (a) FERC is not inclined to do much
more on this issue, (b) FERC wants to fix the market as much as it can given
the current political realities, and (c) if retroactive refunds become an
issue, we still have our full compliment of resources to later fight this
fight.
I would recommend that the pleading and Alan's testimony be modified to bring
these issues to the top of the ticket.   We should still include all of our
other arguments.
Finally, I want to make sure that Enron is taking the right position by
quietly supporting a $250/Mwh soft cap with safe harbor fixes?  Sue Mara, can
you please try and find out what EPSA, IEPCA, and WPTF are going to file?  I
want to make sure that we are in the ball park on this issue but not getting
too soft.

We have designed an additional Daily Position Report which consolidates P&L, positions, maturity gap, and VAR by commodity rather than business unit.  In accordance with the Risk Policy paragraph III - Limit Structure, possible breaches of limits are monitored against commodities rather than Business Units.

This report is currently being published to the Executive Viewer under the name of DPR RAC (will be retitled to DPR commodity). We are in the process of granting each one of you access to this report.  When access is granted to all DPR viewers, we plan to remove the limits amount off of the Business Unit Daily Position Report as the limits are granted by commodity, not business unit.

Please contact me with any questions/comments or concerns.

Thank you

When this mail was sent to me the

I'm guessing no.  Government bills aren't numbered as indicated below.  The current Senate bill 602 is the "Common Sense Federal Election Reform Act of 2001"; current House bill 602 is "Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act."  No email stuff in either one, I would assume.  The only email related bill is HR2281 "The Digital Divide Elimination Act of 2001."  This relates to tax credits to help lower-income people buy computers.  I can't find a record of any "Representative Tony Schnell."  I would also note that the Washington magazine is a monthly, not a weekly as suggested below.

Also, most "PLEASE FORWARD TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!!" emails are hoaxes.  This was a fun test- got any more?!

Two weeks ago I toured the Depelchin Center, one of the organizations that
receives much of its funding from the United Way.  I was surprised to find
out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused
Houston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as foster
parents.  I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to
the center.  Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin
and meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who were
temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to
have made that pledge.

Enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive
matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit
organizations.  Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your
charitable giving during the year.  The United Way campaign is the one time
each year that Enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a
difference in the lives of so many in Houston.  Each dollar pledged by an
employee is matched by Enron.

If you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing
so as soon as possible.  Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion next
Wednesday, August 23.  I hope that each one of you will consider making a
pledge.  There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all Enron
employees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.  Log on to
http://unitedway.enron.com to complete your pledge card.

Thanks to the many of you who have already completed your electronic
pledge.

WARNING - THE NEW SITARA RELEASE IS GOING OUT THIS WEEKEND

DON'T BE LOST ON MONDAY

THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE TO SEE A DEMO BEFORE WE GO LIVE

Reminder - A New SITARA release with a complete redesign of Risk Assignment
is scheduled to be implemented into production this weekend.

Please make every effort to attend the last demo:

WHERE: EB 5C2

WHEN: Jan 20 - 4:30 - 5:30

There are some major changes to SITARA that will result in a transformation
of every deal with risk assignment.
This release includes the introduction of financial deal types needed for
SITARA valuation and eventual replacement
of CPR and TAGG systems for natural gas.


You are encouraged to invite anyone you believe may be interested in
attending.

We are going to add a new drop down flag to STORAGE in SITARA to
differentiate the difference between physical and synthetic storage - as each
are
treated differently for inventory accounting purposes.   A change will also
be made to Global Contracts and UNIFY, and is intended to assist with OA
variances
on STORAGE.

On the next release (mid August) we will add a drop down on the STORAGE deal
type which will be a required field.
Someone will need to edit the existing deals to add the flag - as it will be
a required field - physical facility or synthetic.
(We can create queries to work with you on identifying deals that need to be
converted - as well as results for Global conversion)

Global Contracts uses the flags from SITARA to set up new contracts - so
SITARA will add the flag on the deal.

The flag will be stored in Global Contracts - which will feed the flag to
UNIFY.

Once the existing deals are converted in SITARA, Global Contracts can add the
appropriate flag to their system.
Once this is complete and UNIFY is ready, UNIFY can begin to feed in the
information from Global Contracts, and we will then
be able to differentiate the two in the accounting system.

In the interim time, you may want to identify your synthetic vs. physical
storage deals.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi folks,
Sadly, this is my last day at Enron in Houston.  I've been here two years and 2 days, and have had a great time working here.  The longer I have been here, the better I have liked working here - probably because I got to know you all better.  If you are in New Zealand any time in the next 5 or 10 years, I would like you to stay at my house and update me on life at Enron - we will be living in Wellington, which is at the bottom of the North Island.

Chonawee,

This was perfectly all right. As a matter of fact I expect and encourage
the members of the group to disagree with me (or anybody else)
on any subject. I am never offended by it and take it as a manifestation
of ability to think independently and having the courage of one' s
convictions.

Nobody has the monopoly on truth and nobody knows everything. The only
way we can learn and avoid costly errors (to ourselves and the
company) is by having open communication.  In Enron,
facts are friendly.

By the way, it was an excellent presentation.

In order to document the termination extension, Peoples will be preparing a bilateral agreement for Laura's execution.  They prefer a bilateral agreement because they feel that if they unilaterally extend the termination they may erode their position relevant to a termination at a later date.

Team,

Another great meeting this month!  Thanks for your participation.

Please mark your calendar for our next Vision and Values meeting - Wednesday,
August 16 from 9am until noon in eb 46c1.

Below summarizes the key points from our July 19 meeting:

Communications Training
Feedback from I&I continues to be positive.
The number of vp's and above not enrolled in Executive Impact and Influence
increased to 111.  The increase is the result of cancellations.
We had a discussion about what the "quantifiable penalty" would be for vp's
and above who DID NOT participate in the Executive Impact and Influence
training.  I continue to research this issue.  I hope to have an update at
our next meeting on August 16.
Work continues on the development on Executive Impact and Influence II.  The
design of this one-day training session is slated to be completed by the end
of August.  The plan is to conduct the first training session by the end of
September.  P&D training will be included in the course curriculum.
Development of the on-line communications course continues working with
Cognitive Arts with a target completion of year end.  V&V Task Force members
will receive a call from Cognitive Arts to provide input into the design of
the course.

Communication Tools
The updated PeopleFinder and ExpertFinder are on schedule.  PeopleFinder
should be available at the end of July and ExpertFinder should be available
by mid-September.

P&D
Work continues to roll P&D out in the new Enron tool, ThinkBank.  Initial map
sites for drop down content on the P&D flowchart are being developed.
Facilitators are currently being identified throughout the organization.
We need all V&V Task Force members to communicate with their business units
about using this tool when appropriate.

Communication Campaign
Additional products continue to be distributed throughout the Houston Enron
building with interesting Enron facts.
Targeted international offices received their Vision and Values posters.

Diversity
Dick Liebert reported that questions for the ETC survey are currently being
developed.
Three additional Diversity Focus Groups are being held to include the
perspective of commercial employees.
A meeting of the entire Diversity Task Force is scheduled for Sept. 26.

Best Companies Survey
Mary Clark and team completed Enron's application and forwarded it to Fortune
on July 25.  Keep your fingers crossed!

That covers the high points of the meeting.  Please let me know if you have
additional information to share with the group.  Beth and I will see you
August 16.

Joannie: Thank you very much. I appreciate Jeff giving me a few minutes out of his busy schedule (May 24 at 3:00 p.m.). Here are some questions that are pertinent for our discussion.
Are there two or three experiences you look back on having been especially valuable in helping develop your leadership style? Why did you find them valuable?
How have your views on leadership changed over time?
How do you think organizational changes or global changes impact on leadership styles?
What motivates you and how do you motivate others?
Do you ever have time to reflect on your leadership style in a particular instance? if so, what process do you use for evaluation?
What are the most important leadership skills for the energy industry? Does leadership style change for other industries, such as the airline industry or the automobile industry?

Don:
This sounds like to same offering that we previously received about two weeks ago from Michael Kolman (not our Michael Coleman) of Navigant. Was the offering you received from Navigant as well?
FYI, Navigant (again, Michael Kolman) is representing us on the sale of our SW501D5A, and we have frequent updates with him on our turbine as well as other turbines and sites being offered in the market.

I have never received any expense in my bank account, probably due to the difference in the names on the systems.  This is a huge issue and I need to know how much money is missing immediately and how this gets resolved.  I would think that we issued them in 'Kitchen' and therefore they were bounced by my account which is in 'Nettelton'.  I may be wrong if this is a common problem.
I may never have been paid any.  Please check all expenses going back all year.
This is a huge number which state they have been paid and have not hit my bank account.
Of the expenses showing up not cleared on my bank account I have received none of the payments which I think adds up as follows:
11/13/01	4,069:72
11/10/01	21,010:15
11/10/01	3,319:40
Plus I have a cheque for a prior expense which bounced which is for about $4000.
In pre- petition expenses this is clearly more than $5000.
In post petition - I also have expenses pending which will bounce if the name on the payee does not correspond to the account holder name.

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options.

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

Hello everyone.  More fun issues from Chicago.  I would like to discuss the
different options available for giving parent guarantees to third parties.
As everyone knows, to date we have had two third party transactions requiring
parent guarantees.  In the Trunkline transaction, each parent issued separate
guarantees for 1/2 of the requested amount, negotiated by respective
counsel.  In the Alliance transaction, Enron issued a guarantee for the
entire amount and Peoples has presented us with a reimbursement agreement
which we are reviewing.  Peoples' Board meets next Wednesday, Oct. 4, to
approve the risk management policy.  Assuming the policy is approved, deal
flow should begin to increase and I would like to discuss how these
guarantees can best be handled going forward.  My thought was an hour or so
next Monday, Oct. 2, to the extent everyone is available, with a follow up
meeting with Peoples perhaps Wednesday.  Let me know how your calendar looks
and I will coordinate the meeting.
Jeff & Kay:  Although this has been initially focused on parent guarantees,
this is part of a larger issue regarding negotiations of enovate contracts in
general.  For instance, we have agreed to templates for a Master Purchase and
Sale Agreement and a GISB Agreement.  However, who is authorized to make
changes and negotiate on behalf of enovate?  We can discuss any suggestions
for handling these situations as well.
Thanks,

The request is only for the month of February.  Approximately $1.2M is needed as a prepayment to receive cash flow of $1.6MM.  The counterparties that are willing to supply ENA are as follow:  Alliant Energy Resources, Nicor Energy L.L.C.,  MidAmerican, NG Energy, and Sequent.

John,
I have reviewed the contracts (Asset Agreement and the GPA) and here are my thoughts regarding your request.  In short, the agreements do not specifically address capacity being needed by third parties.  ENA does have a right to all of their capacity free and clear of all encumbrances.  Last year we did discuss this issue (the interruptible VNG customers wanting to take releases of VNG capacity), but at the time Jim Scabareti indicated that he was going to play hard ball with his interruptible shippers in year 2 (i.e. now), since VNG was really getting tight on assets due year-on-year load growth and no new capacity additions.  He gave the assets up last year because he did not want to have any noise at the VSCC when the VSCC was considering the affiliate relationship between VNG and AGLES.  However, as I reflect on it now, it seems to me that VNG (aka Sequent) really needs to weigh heavily the decision to release any assets to third parties through this winter (interruptible or otherwise).  At a minimum, any releases should be done recallable based on weather forecasts based on some HDD amount.  The profit sharing provision is the same for years 1 and 2.

My suggestion is that you do the following: (1) remind Sequent about the deliverability issue facing VNG and (2) develop a plan with Sequent for talking to Customers, so as to minimize any VSCC risk since the VSCC thinks Sequent is VNG's asset manager.

Mark Breese is back in the office tomorrow and I will confer with him as well.  You might seek Jeff Hodge's thoughts as well.  If you have any questions, please ask.

Ed

GREAT JOB TO ALL!!   We made it from contract execution to financial close in 5 months.  This success is a testament to the effort put forth by all of you and your colleagues in finalizing the transaction, including:

1.	Setting an industry record for responding to a 2nd request from the Dept. of Justice and securing their approval.
2.	Expediting the analysis and repair of a 60 mile segment of the A/S pipeline.
3.	Transitioning HPL's hardware and software infrastructure from Enron to AEP
4.	Unwinding four complex monetizations related to the assets with a value of over $150MM
5.	Separating HPL's business process, work flow, from Enron (after 75 years of integrated operation)
6.	Segregating property between leased and purchased facilities
7.	Collecting and sorting over 14,000 boxes of books and records
8.	Moving over 250 people from 4 different Enron entities into a new location while keeping the pipeline operating.
7.	Accounting for the transfer of PRM assets, CWIP, leased assets, purchased assets, imbalances, payables and receivables.

The transaction freed up approximately $725MM of capital that Enron can put to work earning higher rates of return in its newer businesses, but the work on HPL is not over yet.  There are a number of follow up activities that we need to complete in order to maximize the value of the HPL transaction.  Jim Coffey will be managing these activities on an ongoing basis, including:

1.	Collecting outstanding accounts receivable and working with AEP to resolve imbalances.
2.	Closing out accounting entries for property, work orders, external accounts payable, and internal charges.
3.	Eliminating and mitigating any impact from retained assets and liabilities.
4.	Fully transitioning HPL systems, facilities, and books/records to AEP.

Again, thank you for your effort - and if I have inadvertently missed anyone please pass along my appreciation to them as well.  We will be hosting a lunch for the Enron/HPL employees who worked on the transaction on the 15th of June at 12:00 in the Imperial Ballroom at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.

My understanding is that we have posted bonds in excess of $60M and are in compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy.
EPMI and EES are not relying upon an Enron Corp. guaranty to provide any part of the financial assurance required by NEPOOL.

Suggest we can take one of four courses of action:  (1)   Do nothing;

(2)    Request and authorize the ISO-NE to disclose to concerned NEPOOL participants the fact that EPMI and EES 						           have posted bonds to ensure compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy and that no part of the    						           financial assurance required is provided by an Enron Corp. guaranty;

(3)    Send a letter to all NEPOOL participants confirming that EPMI and EES financial assurance obligations are being 						           met solely by the posting of bonds;

(4)    Combination of both (2) and (3).


If there is a perception or a clear understanding that the credit downgrade of Enron Corp. is the reason for a reduction in trading activity with EPMI and/or EES in NEPOOL and that NEPOOL participants will respond favorably if they knew that the financial assurance is provided by way of bonds, not an Enron Corp. guaranty, then option (1) should be discarded.

Option (2) may be enough to give the comfort to "concerned" participants.

Option (3) and (4) will ensure that any letter we send out will make its way into the press, almost as soon as it is sent and if we send any such letter out we need to be prepared to meet any media interest. Further, the publication of any such letter in the press may encourage other counterparties in other forum to demand that EPMI and/or EES post bonds in order to continue trading and could materially adversely affect our trading activities.

If we considered that any disclosure would make a material difference to the confidence that NEPOOL participants have in trading with EPMI and/or EES, my recommendation would be to pursue Option (2).

The language should state that both parties are not setting a precedence and are not waiving any existing rights.  The volume/dollar amount is not based on anything specific.  Please do not send dispute notice response.  I believe that we will have a deal.

He is also mentioned that we should see their response to the test protocol tomorrow.

They received the CO2 response and it was what he expected.  They are currently claiming Force Majuere on their Praxair contract, but have not been sued yet. They were pleased with the fact that we are posting a quality reminder and are feeling better about their chances of a commercial solution with CIG.

They are also planning to send us some kind of communication (demand letter) on EPPI.

Sorry for the abbreviated note.  If you have questions, call me.

Please mark your calendars for a East Power Trading Pre PRC Meeting to be held June 18th 2001 at 2pm-4pm in Room EB49C3.


Prior to the meeting, you will receive a spreadsheet that will contain the names of the individuals that you are listed to represent as of the cut off date of 4/30/01.  I will need you to review  the names to ensure that we have captured the information accurately.   Bear in mind that I am aware that changes have been made in regards to your direct reports since then.  Individuals that have been with the company less than 6 months will not be rated, however, they will go through the feedback and performance review process.

Items to bring to the meeting include:

1.   Copies of the supervisor feedback reports from the PEP system  (if you have difficulty retrieving this information, please contact me),
2.   A list of each employee's accomplishments  (also listed in PEP under the employee self review section)
3.   A pre-rank for each employee under your supervision.


Note: it is important that you review the employees accomplishments in the PEP system prior to attending a PRC meeting as this information will show up on the screen during the meeting.  If an employee has not entered this information into the PEP system, please meet with them in advance to obtain this information in order for you to be prepared.  Feel free to contact me should you have additional questions.

This is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS
information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed
as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.
With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com
on the command line of your browser.
The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.
Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.

Texaco has short paid us by 1.5 million for Socal cuts.  I believe that they claimed a penalty on the net out for the amount.  We do not agree with this short pay and stand by the description of the Socal product in which it states that there will be cuts due to operational constraints on the upstream pipelines.  I would like to return the short pay favor to Texaco.  Please let me know how we should proceed.

Where dates overlap (key violations), just leave the existing Ts and scrap the Ds.  Second, please move the usage data for 279577 with pipeline number 6 to the same DRN with pipeline number 43 and delete the location under pipeline 6, as this is a manually entered point.

The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations.

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the survey.

Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for contributing to this important learning opportunity.

To complete the GLOBE Network Survey, please click on the link below and simply follow the survey instructions.  You will need to enter the Enron Company Code, which is:

C673EV

Thanks so much for your quick response.  Are the other 215 'master' type
contracts?  I would agree that the Appalachian deals probably won't get
assigned - these are John Singer's I believe.  I am really only concerned
about those contracts where we are selling gas.  To the extent that you can
help Bryce Baxter determine which of those unasssigned deals are sales so he
can quantify the delivery risk, I would greatly appreciate it.  Jeff, I
assume that the 215 that do not have deals are really defunct, since all new
deals would be done on ENA paper?

Mr. Martin,

I wanted to take a moment this morning to provide you an update on your recent ESOP change request.  I have received confirmation from Corporate Benefits that your form has been received.  Unfortunately due to current switch over of our Savings vendor, which was also the vendor for our ESOP program, we are still experimenting the blackout period on any savings plan activity through November 20th.

Also, I wanted to point out my error with the processing of your form.  Since this was a very old stock program form, I accidentally confused it for an enrollment form to our direct service program, which is the program that allows employees to purchase stock through payroll deduction twice a month.  In a nutshell, I accidentally forwarded your form to the incorrect resource and then had to re-route it to the correct group which is our corporate contact for the 401(K) savings plan.

I apologize for the delay in providing you with this update and am extremely sorry for my mistake.   Please let me know if there is anything that I can do asides from following up with Corporate benefits after the blackout period to check on the status of your request and then I will provide your asst, Laura with an update.

Thanks.

Over the past few weeks, we've put together some rules for each group as to whether or not they will be officializing, how frequently etc.  However, since the data I'm sending you today is the 12/31 data, many of these rules don't apply.  For the 12/31 data, we want to ensure we have correct VAR & counterparty data for SEC reporting, so for those of you that are not officializing due to lack of staff, we still need you to calc and officialize your data for the 31st.

Over the next day or so, based on the below, I will be following up with each of you to determine if there is any VAR or counterparty risk that was not captured and then asking you to officialize the 12/31 books so we can pick up the complete information for the 31st.  I will then put together a deadline to get it done so I can rerun VAR.

Thanks for your cooperation.  If you have any questions or comments, please call me at X39123.

Just to follow up on our conversation about the PMA, here is a summary of my comments:

1. The add to 3.6 is good.  In addition, with regard to MGU's obligation in "(a)" therein, please address or stipulate the actions that MGU is required to take with regard to maintaining assets sufficient to meet their merchant load requirements through contract extensions, contract replacements &/or new contracts during the term.  I know that our sales obligation is limited by the aggregate limit of the contracts assigned to us, but I do not think that we want to rely solely on that to incent MGU to maintain a full compliment of assets.

2.  In Section 5.3(d), the term "support" might need to be fully addressed with MGU.  Not that we need to change the language, but it sounds like we could eliminate a potential misunderstanding if we gain a clear understanding now about the scope of their expectations and make sure that from day 1 of the agreement that the parties are clear as to what is expected of each other.  Thereafter, we will need to take whatever steps necessary internally, including systems, people, processes, etc, to be able to fulfill that commitment.  ENA has good systems for producing reports in for running our business.  As we have found in the VNG deal, where we really have no reporting requirements, generating reports and data in response to VSCC regulatory requests has been VERY manual and time consuming.  To that end, you will likely need to consider adding staff to respond to the requests.

The other changes to the PMA and the GPA in total look fine.  If you have any questions, please ask.

Keep swinging,
Ed

Chris,

Per our conversation, the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to track/compute/report, etc.


Background

The west desk currently displays storage balances on several of the morning reports.  These balances are not reported by the respective pipelines, however, each day the injections and withdrawals are available.  In the past, our excel spreadsheets have tracked the running balances by simply adding the current daily activity to the prior day's balance.  As we get validation of the balances through phone calls, and/or postings, we tweak the balances to maintain an accurate representation.  Currently, our reporting/storage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reports.

Task

Synthesize the currently used method of displaying storage balances for the storage facilities shown on the following table.  It is our intent to have a DRN established (and some already have been created) that would hold the storage balance each day.  However, this requires that a calculation be executed to determine the value to be placed in the database.  One possibility is to have the scraping script make the necessary calculation and store the new storage balance each time the pipeline is scraped.  Another possibility is to incorporate the ability to do these calculations in the report, while a third option is too keep a spreadsheet with storage balances that queries the database for the daily activity.  Lastly, these storage balances could be manual entry points, but would require manual calculation each day (representing a lower level of performance than the existing system for this feature).

Timeline

This is a necessary feature before transitioning from the current spreadsheets.  At a minimum, we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week.  Although, we do not have a final date for transitioning, we see this as one of a few critical tasks.

The New England Conference of Public Utilities Commissioners (NECUPUC) filed
an Answer if Support of the Motion of the Maine Public Utilities Commission
for Disclosure of Information.
NECUPUC supports the request for the release of the unredacted copies of
ISO-NE's September 21, 2000 Answer in this case.  In the alternative, they
would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to
the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21, 2000 Answer
subject to an appropriate protective order.

Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC
request for public information.

DENA argues that only a  three month lag in the release of confidential
information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services
Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information.
Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL
markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit.
If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information, then it
should be subject to a protective order which contains the following:
The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket.
Only specifically named "reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review
the information.
The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises.
The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate.


Answer to the MPUC's Motion for Disclosure of Information from Northeast
Utilities Service Company and Select Energy and request for expedited
commission action.  NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for
disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal, but opposes the
selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory
commissions and not other participants.   NUSCO and Select Energy request
expedited action due the financial implications and there is also
considerable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market in
January, February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pending
Commission guidance.

principles established.

Based on that preparation,  I would like the agenda of the meeting to be as
follows :

I.  Key Stakeholder Groups
- Have all relevant stakeholder groups been identified?
- Should some groups be deleted?

II. Environics Role
- Will take our stakeholder groups and identify relevant entities to

- Set up meeting to discuss sample questions
- Catherine attached the Environics Stakeholder Perception Survey

III. Principles / Codes of Conduct
- Identify Favorites
-Discuss Weaknesses of Most Popular Choice
- Discuss  Notes from GEMI Session

Colin,
Per our conversation, I have outlined Keith's task for the team....
Background:  Portland maintains in their database a table called "PlantOutage".  Records in that table each contain an outage "BeginOutageDate", "EndOutageDate", "CapacityOut" and "OutageReason".  Records also include a PlantID (key field for PlantCharacteristics table) and a PlantUnitID (key field for Unitcharacteristics table).  The PlantCharacteristics table contains a "WSCCRegion" field and the Unitcharacteristics table contains a "Fuel_Designation" field.
Portland has a stored procedure that for a specified date range can calculate for each date the sum of "CapacityOut" for all outage records where the date falls between the "BeginOutageDate" and the "EndOutageDate".  I have inlcuded the results of this storaged procedure in the attached file.  Our task is similar but requires more detailed subgrouping of the data.
Objective:  The objective is to return the Sum of "CapacityOut" by each possible subgrouping for each day in a range (say 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2001).  There are roughly five possible parameters for "Fuel_Designation", seven for "WSCCRegion", and two for "OutageReason".  The resulting query would return approximately 70 values for each day within the specified range.
Format:  Ultimately we will have the date in one excel sheet with dates down the left and each of the 70 sub groupings across the top.  It would be most convenient if the results of the query were formatted in this way.  Alternatively, we can use a pivot table if the results of a list query are provided.  If the second option is used, we will need to get the data in two separate lists since excel can only hand 65,000+ rows.  In this case, we would use the "OutageReason" grouping (which only has two parameters) to split out the two lists.
Thanks for your help.

Answer of PJM Interconnection, LLC., to Motion of New England Public Power
Systems for Deferral of decision until January 15, 2001.  At issue is whether
a ruling by the FERC on the merits of PJM as an RTO may set an unfair
precident that may affect other regional RTO filings.  In their answer PJM
asks that the FERC not delay action as requested by NEPPS and argues that the
fact that a decision may be precedential clearly is not a basis for
withholding a decision.  PJM adds that Commission guidance as a precedent
would in fact, be beneficial to RTO development.  PJM is also concerned that
a delay would affect the creation of PJM West with Allegheny Power since a
deferal until January 15, 2001 may affect the negotiations and implementation.

Dear Jeff,

I am interested in summarizing all of our contracts in the western region and
identifying any problems (i.e. penalty language, notification deadlines for
OFOs, etc.) that may need to be addressed.  We have experienced a few
problems with SW Gas Corp. recently.  They have been penalizing Enron for
cuts on EPNG, but when we pursued penalties with them on a baseload one month
deal last month, they claimed that all one month deals have been booked on an
interruptible contract and cannot be penalized.  This was news to me.  Can
you help me identify what types of contracts we are using to transact
business with our customers in the west?

I can honestly say that these contracts have not been reviewed by the west
desk for some time.  Phillip Allen transferred the desk to me  in August of
2000 and I have not spent the time to review all of contracts.  Let's get
together and discuss exactly what I may need.

Jeff,

Following on from our brief discussion during your last visit to London, I
just wanted to give you a heads-up on where we are with the Du Pont/ETOL
steam/power deal given the discussions you and Harold had with them earlier
in the year.  Based on prior experience in getting to closure with Du Pont,
there is a chance that someone senior from Du Pont will put in a call to you
or maybe Lou/Tom to express disappointment on progress and encourage Enron
concessions, resulting in premature deal closure for us.

ETOL has tabled a blend-and-extend deal to Du Pont, in which they have shown
interest to get to closure.  However, they just want to transact on the major
value items for themselves now and then deal with other Enron value items
next year in good faith.  We have indicated that we will commit Enron
resource to get the whole deal done as soon as possible, specifying a Jan 01
start, and will not allow cherry picking.

Whilst the overall impact to ETOL is PV neutral, the deal does substantially
reduce long term volume risk on what is already a deep in the money deal for
us.  The motivation for DuPont is that the deal results in immediate annual
savings, around $3m in 2001, which fits with their corporate goal to deliver
energy savings.

If you are called by Du Pont and need more info let me know.  We want the
whole package from them.

I have been coordinating with Gregg Penman, Richard Tomaski, Hunter Shively, Jeff Hodge, Lou Stoler, etc. and will set a meeting for Thursday to discuss how to proceed regarding PEC.  My assistant will coordinate the meeting.  I do not want this contract/s discussed in a large group due to the confidential nature and the protection of the ongoing Chicago business.

The list below that Cyndie prepared contains approximately 300 contracts that
have not been assigned. Can we verify that these are all contracts that are
active?  Also, who in our organization is continuing to pursue these
assignments?  Columbia would like to reduce the guaranty (I have agreed to a
reduction due to Risk's analysis that no MTM exposure exists, only delivery
which I have asked Bryce Baxter to quantify); however, further reductions are
dependent on Bryce being able to determine the receivable risk assosciated
with the unassigned, active contracts.

Due to the additional activity within ETS and the holidays, we will not hold a GISB Update meeting during the remainder of this year.  Hopefully we'll get back on a schedule after the first of the year.  Below is my update on a few GISB matters.  We'll go into more detail at our next meeting.

ENERGY INDUSTRY STANDARDS BOARD (EISB)
The GISB Board of Directors has approved revisions to GISB's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to incorporate language necessary to transition to the new organization, which will address standards for wholesale and retail gas and electric transactions.  The new organization, which goes into effect January 1, 2002, will be named the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB).  The wholesale gas quadrant, which is now GISB, should continue with business as usual.  In January, I'll give a more detailed update on the workings of NAESB.

GISB REPRESENTATON
Stan Horton's term on the GISB Board of Directors expires December 31, 2001.  Shelley Corman will take his place on the Board.  Her term expires December 31, 2003.
My term as a representative on GISB's Executive Committee expires December 31, 2003.

ORDER 637 TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING
The development of the new transactional reporting datasets for use on EBBs is almost complete.  The EBB implementation should be included in the next publication, which is scheduled for July 31, 2002.  This is probably a firm date.  The EDI implementation is now a lower priority, but will still be developed.

GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS AND ERRATA
Two separate errata have been developed for the version 1.5 standards.  The errors in the standards books are extensive.  The errata are posted alongside the books on the GISB homepage and have been distributed internally to all who received standards books.  I am working to have GISB correct the standards books.  Some people want to hold off and incorporate the corrections into the next version.  Our implementation will be much smoother if we don't have to continually refer to the errata along with the standards books.  I'll let you know what is decided.

Theresa

Chris,

For the following dates, we do not have Cycle 7 data in the database for PG&E (Pipeline #17).  These should have been reloaded from the saved html files.  Do we have these files, and if so, can you load the appropriate dates, in order the get the Cycle 7 data in for these points.


2/8/01
3/7/01
3/8/01
3/9/01
3/10/01
3/11/01
3/12/01


For the following dates, the data we have for Cycle 7 in the database does not match that in the spreadsheet that the west desk maintains.  We need to verify from the saved webpages whether our data is correct, and if it isn't, get it corrected.  I could check them, if you could print out the saved pages for me.

2/12/01
2/27/01
3/1/01
4/11/01
4/16/01
4/17/01

For both of these, the actual date of capture will be several days later than the effective date for cycle 7.

Due to the sale of HPL we will be modifying  the General Terms and Conditions ("GTC") governing all North American physical natural gas transactions on EnronOnline, on Nov 5th. This will require all Counterparties' not having a Master Agreement governing Physicals to accept the revised GTC in order to continue transacting in these Physicals.
In order to ensure minimal disruption to trading we are taking the following steps.
There will be a pop-up announcement to this effect on EnronOnline on Monday Oct 29th
There will be a ticker with the same information all week , next week on EnronOnline.
The modified version of the GTC will be available on EnronOnline all week, next week for any customers wishing to have their legal departments review it before they accept it.
The EnronOnline marketing group will be contacting customers who had previously accepted the GTC to make sure they are comfortable with the changes.

Mike,

I had a short conversation with Michael Brown regarding this organizational announcement.  As you can see, Eric Shaw is now responsible among other areas LNG terminal development in Europe.  Michael explained that this expansion of EEL's efforts was at the initiative of John Sheriff.  He recommended that you and John have a conversation in order to agree on our groups responsibilities and efforts.  As per our 2002 plan we have already begun the review of Europe to determine the economic feasibility of a terminal with the objective of making a determination in Q1 2002.

I agree with Michael in that it would be my preference for you and John to iron this out as opposed to having conflicts at the working levels among our groups.  Obviously, we need the EEL gas desk to make a sharp market for current and future LNG deliveries.

My pitch to John would be that we would like to have a similar relationship with EEL as we do with ENA.  (i.e. they make a market for pipeline gas and we develop terminals, we take terminal positions, we build and manage the global Enron merchant portfolio, etc.)  Two obvious benefits to our current structure are a coherent global LNG strategy and one risk book to manage the associated business risks.

Regards,
Eric

PS.  There were no objections to my thoughts on structure so we have concentrated on the rationale supporting RTO's and effective spot markets as mechanisms that achieve the goals of ICAP (i.e A spot market is Enrons solution).  We then state that if others have different views, any resulting separate iCap proposal if implemented should be interim in nature and minimise spot market distortions.  Finally we attach a simple interim solution as an appendix (so it does not detract from our main argument structure) so that if there is an ongoing debate we will be able to take part...

have a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.
From an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should
proceed given the circumstances. Kay and my initial plan is to review the
contracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a
revised indicative number by Tuesday in consultation with Duran. Between now
and then, it would be helpful to know from accounting / finance how we should
proceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I'm told three other

17.  The performance review process is critical to year-end evaluations and
bonus, promotion and compensation decisions. This year, as in previous review
periods, the system enables "360 degree" feedback throughout the organization.

I hope that all of you will attend this meeting, either in person on via video conference.  To make our time productive, please come prepared with the following:
1)  List of what we have done well in Operations and will want to repeat as UBS Warburg Energy.   This can be in your specific area of responsiblity or broader across all aspects of Operations (running risk books, broker check-out, confirmation prep, execution and tracking, scheduling, volume management, settlements, collections, operational analysis, etc.) .
2)  With the luxury of no history and a fresh start, what would you do differently?  Please be specific, and again your suggestions can relate to your area of responsibility or may be broader.
3)  If you could change or enhance one thing about the operating systems that you use to do your job, what would that be?  Please be specific and constructive on this.  An answer of "Unify" for instance, will be too broad.

As part of the recently negotiated agreement with United Parcel Service (UPS), Enron employees may now utilize two new letter centers when sending packages after hours.  These letter centers are located in Three Allen Center, on the ground level, behind the down escalator, near the U.S. Postal Services self-service area and in the Enron Building, at the back of the escalators near the automated teller machine.
Letter-sized envelopes, as well as boxes up to 18"x 13" x 3" can be shipped via Next-Day Air, Second-Day Air, Third-Day Select, UPS International and UPS World-Wide Express Service.
In order to eliminate service disruptions, please apply a completed label to the envelope or box, in accordance with previously communicated shipping instructions.  When utilizing the shipping documentation available at the letter center, please include the Enron account number and your company code and cost center in the reference fields.
Pick up times at the letter centers are 7:45 p.m. for Three Allen Center and 8:00 p.m. for the Enron Building, Monday through Friday.

Gentlemen,

I recommend that we purchase this package and split the cost 3 ways between 3
power trading desks.
I think that we should go for option 3 (~ $15,000).

very useful for modeling transmission problems.
Please, feel free to ask him for technical details in support of this
recommendation.

I just wanted to pass you a note on these guys, since we had you call Bob Nardelli a couple of months ago to see what we could get going. Home Depot issued and RFQ and we responded with a non-conforming bid. We have, however, been chosen to exclusively negotiate with them (beat out Reliant and TXU) for their energy spend west of the Mississippi. We are focusing on a spend of about $50mm a year. We are also looking to help them with some of their problems in California, They entered into a number of 1-2 year deals with third party providers that were brokered for them by SRI and as they expire, they don't want to go back to the utilities.

Just wanted to let you know that we are making progress, and at the right time I may ask you to make another call to Nardelli.

New Subjects;

- I also have hooked up with Liz Flynn at Chase. She is an executive vice president and reports directly to Shapiro. She will look to me as the senior Enron contact for our deal and is aware and supportive of the corrective actions we are taking as well as the need for some restructuring.

- As you know, we have recently closed 3 deals with Sam Zell's Equity Office Properties. We did 5 year deals for their Chicago, NY and Boston based properties. We are in the midst of looking at other regions as well as negotiating a term sheet for an off-balance sheet partnership that would perform DSM and look at Distributed Generation opportunities at their properties. I think it would be great to have you call Sam and say how great it is that we were able to begin doing business together. I will send sheri a note with his number and some deal details if that is acceptible to you.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise
These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.
The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen
First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Elsa/Ken, what's the status on the deliverables for weather, heating oil, and propane? Following is what I recall from our last meeting:

Weather:

1.) Physically locate 2 individuals on EES product floor that will focus solely on weather products to our retail customer base, they should be sitting here now.
2.) Have at least one weather product fully developed/structured and ready to roll-out to the sales folks in the targeted customer channel. The timeline on this was        Monday, September 10th. Be sure you have a weather contract fully developed and sign-off from retail legal (Vicki Sharp).

Heating Oil/Propane:

1.) Have one person identified to manage both products together. Physically locate them on same floor with EES product development. Timeframe on this was this week.

I'd like to set up a meeting with both of you, Jeremy, Vicki and myself to review the product and marketing approach before we roll it out to the sales force.

Dear all,
Following up with Vince's meeting on full requirement, we might just start
with the existing Psim model.
The attached spreadsheet  is still running !
You need to create a directory H:\projects\pwrsim before your run the model.
If you want to re-run the model,
you need to close the report because re-run causes the program re-write the
report.
Let us first review what is already there in the PSIM model, if we can live
with the simplistic dispatch
logic in PSIM, the PSIM is the deliverable product for the full requirement
deal.

Richard and I met with Raulie, Dave and Tim this morning to discuss the implications of the termination and our ability to continue to fulfill our obligations regarding the deals that are subject to the Master.  After much discussion, they (PGL) have agreed to delay any termination until either the end of January or February (they are going to discuss internally which makes more sense).  Therefore, unless a higher power overturns our agreement, PGL intends to issue a letter amending their previous notification/assurance letter.

On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding "Peer Group Mapping".  This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.
Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to David Oxley and have any comments
please respond to him by May 25, 2001.
Dave Delainey
Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.
We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached.
The actions points from this excercise are:
1	to review and agree the attached mapping
2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.
3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.
Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.
To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of

This is disturbing.  I can not understand how an HR employee for an Enron
business unit can deny access to what appears to be an Enron auditor on the
grounds that the records being sought are confidential.  As you know Sanjay
reports to both Ken and myself in support of EBS Asia activities as well as I
believe McDonald for Global Assets.  Given this split accountability, and the
fact that I do not know which business unit these records apply to, you as a
representative of Corp should probably require that Enron be given access to
these records as part of your audit responsibilities.  If you think it
appropriate for me to make the request I will be happy to do so.

Randy Lord with building maintenance advised us that HL&P had a switch problem that caused the Enron building to lose all commercial power. The UPS systems switched to the auxillary generators and there was minimal impact to the computer rooms and Gas Control Center during the outage. The backup chiller on the roof did not kick in automatically and building maintenance performed the switch manually. The computer rooms warmed up a bit, but not enough to be a problem. They plan to bring contractors in tomorrow morning to determine what the problem was with the backup chiller. The Gas Logistics business systems did lose one server but there was minimal to no business impact. Gas Control was not impacted.

We will check with Randy tomorrow morning to see if HL&P has determined the root cause of their equipment failure. Let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

US Financial Markets
Emergency Site Relocation
The emergency site relocation for firms affected by the WTC bombing is going well on the fixed income and commodities trading side. Trading is being relocated largely to New Jersey and Connecticut. There was very significant contingency planning here, and it is being put to good use. The futures and equities markets are not moving as quickly due to telecommunications problems. Bond trading, which will resume in Tokyo tonight (as reported in the press), means that the cash market in the US should start to come back tomorrow.
Forex
The foreign exchange markets have been quiet, as the Fed reportedly stepped in and told people to settle their outstanding issues, but not to initiate new directional positions or large arbitrages.
Insurance
The insurance firms most affected by the crisis are ING Reinsurance and Allianz. These firms may have capital issues from insuring losses related to the crisis - they were overconcentrated in this area.
Transportation/Infrastructure Issues
Telecommunications
Communication issues continue to be the biggest problem. This is the only area where sufficient redundancy was lacking. For example, Citigroup is having problems with e-mail capacity and is cutting back on all non-essential e-mails. This continues to be the chief barrier to resuming operations.
Crude/Products/Refineries
LOOP Terminal now restored to regular operations.
Maritime Traffic
According to Dow Jones, dry bulk shipowners were reluctant to lease out vessels on long-term contracts Wednesday, after terrorist attacks in the U.S. Tuesday brought security issues to the fore
Air Traffic
Midway Airlines announced today that effective immediately it has suspended all future flight operations. Their press release states that "this action is being taken at this time in order to preserve the value available for Midway's interest holders and with the recognition that following the recent terrorist attacks demand for air transportation is expected to decline sharply."
US-Canada Border
BC border open but moving very slowly. Delay for trucks at BC truck crossing now up to about 6 hrs. Truckers being sorted into two groups, those with papers and order and those without papers in order.All trucks being checked extensively. Only US residents and those on important business are being let back into the US.
Rail Traffic
All Canadian Pacfiic Railway (CPR - freight) operations in Canada and the US continuing to operate as normal. All CPR border crossings open and moving as planned.

We have filed a heads of terms with FERC today which envisages that we will enter into a fully termed agreement next week in which EPMI, EES and EEMC will pre-pay for a rolling three day period starting 27 December for all energy and other services in NEPOOL. NEPOOL will provide an estimate of such costs and expenses by 12.00 a.m. on 26 December and the money will need to be wired to the nominated account, details of which are set out below, by 04:00 p.m. eastern standard time the following Business Day This will occur every Business Day and we therfore need to be set up to wire the amounts of money demanded. It should be noted that NEPOOL require that there be at least three days pre-paid at all times.

There will be a reconciliation at the end of every month. We do have the flexibility to pre-pay for more than three days if it is deemed expedient or prudent to do so.

Leslie Reeves and Wade Stubblefield will be responsible for ensuring that the monies are wired in a timely manner.

John, I plan to speak with Sequent by the end of this week to inform them if we are interested in returning the assets to them and if so under what structure.  I have checked with Cris Sherman and others in Accounting, they have determined that the "East Desk" does not have to accelerate the payment of its "debt" to John Arnold's book if we get out of the Hopewell transaction. That being said, you were checking on the real $$$ exposure to retaining the Hopewell deal past the VNG transaction.  The way we are currently booked we are not interested in restructuring the VNG/Hopwell arrangement. If on the other hand we see real $$$ exposure, this is the perfect time to try to combine the VNG restructuring with the Hopwell exposure.  I need to understand our position this week if possible.

Recent information indicates that the State of Michigan and possibly other
state and industrial parties who have challenged the EPA's NOx SIP Call
regulation in court -- and lost -- will file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme
Court this September.

As you may recall, on June 22, the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit,
upheld the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulations, lifted the stay on the
regulations, and mandated that states move forward with developing and
submitting State Implementation Plans (SIPs) by the end of October 2000.

States that must now develop SIPs include:  Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware,
District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West
Virginia, Wisconsin  (Georgia, Missouri & Wisconsin were excluded from the
regulation by the Appeals Court in its original decision, but will eventually
be re-included in the SIP process)

Impact of a Supreme Court Appeal:

Parties appealing the case to the Supreme Court will likely ask for a stay of
the EPA requirement for states to submit SIPs until the case is finally
decided.    It is not certain whether or not a stay would be granted by the
Court.  An appeal can not be filed until the Court returns at the beginning
of October, and a decision on a stay might not come until after the October
30 SIP deadline, so it many states might proceed with developing their SIP
anyway.   States who choose to not develop a SIP and assume that a stay will
be granted will be taking the risk that they miss the October 30 SIP deadline
and EPA imposes its own Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) -- if the stay is
not granted, the state would have to live with the federal requirements for
NOx reductions in its state.

Another impact is that the May 2003 deadline for implementation of the rule
-- and compliance by emitting sources -- may also be delayed if the Supreme
Court imposes a stay on the regulations and accepts the case on appeal.   If
the case is accepted, a decision would not likely be reached until June 2001,
which would likely delay a compliance deadline until 2004.

We will keep you posted as this situation develops.  Right now, Environmental
Strategies is continuing to work in the states that are developing SIPs, to
ensure that the states treat new generation fairly and that market-based
solutions to NOx reduction are employed so that trading and other
opportunities for Enron businesses will be maximized.

Chonawee,

As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad
decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).

Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option.
You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to
$100.
You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise
gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxes
on your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is
28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss against
ordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes.

Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option
position
as an offset.

The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get the
tax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have
income in the
future (or capital gains).

Not so good.

By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options
is a very interesting and difficult problem.

I think we are on the right track from our meeting yesterday.  I talked to
Patti today and she is confirming the way we want to do things from a users
perspective.  My thought is that we get a good, general, working model as to
how the information will flow, then take it back to our groups and go over
different scenarios within each region, such as Opal Plant, Socal, etc.  We
can see how the information will flow and see what we need to tinker with.

I also have a few questions we need to think about at some point, and I did
not want to forget them.

1.  When we make a change to an existing upstream/downstream contract, how
will we notify the counterparties that a change has occurred.

2.  Should we lock out our customer's at some time so they can't make changes
at a late time?  We could do the rest over the phone.

3.  On EDI pipes, we could conceivably make changes up to 11:45 am, but it
would affect customers whose noms are due at 11:30.

I thought these were just questions we might want to think about.  I'm sure
there are a lot of others.

I want to personally thank you for all of your work following last week's tragic events.  I have come to rely on, and even take for granted, your thoroughness and competence.  Last week was a sterling example of what I have come to expect from your team.

As you know, we were able to quickly account for our traveling employees, keep information flowing to our business units and management, and make quick, sound judgments on the issues we faced. It was gratifying to see such a calm, competent and proactive group assemble and get the job done.


There will be much more to do in the coming weeks and months.  I feel much better about what lies ahead knowing that I can count on you.

I hope all of your family and friends are well.  If you have former colleagues, family or friends who were affected by last week's tragedies, you have my sympathy and my offer to help in any way I can.

Again, my thanks.

The new SITARA to UNIFY bridge monitor is in production.

The monitor shows deals in error state (failed) or in queue to bridge
(pending) - for deals going to UNIFY from SITARA.

You will find it under - Start - Programs - Trading - SITARA - SU Bridge
Monitor.

You may need to load the Borland BDE v5.0 software to use this, if not
already loaded.

We enhanced the monitor to make it a more useful tool.
**EOM**
DOWNSPEAK
**START**
If deal is in an error state on the SITARA side - we have not sent it over to
UNIFY.
If the deal in an error state on the UNIFY side - SITARA has sent it to UNIFY
- however - it is in the UNIFY failed deal group.

You can sort by the columns - best to sort by business unit.

The date column - shows the last time someone edited the deal.
Start Date and Stop Date - are begin and end date of deal.

SITARA deal ID - as well as - EOL deal ID.

Indicates if the deal is an business unit is an agent on the deal.

If you are contract or validation support - please do not edit the STATUS = P
deals - these are the deals with pending status for desk to desk transactions
(awaiting the other desk to approve the deal or changes to the deal).  If you
release these deals - you will be the approver of the deal - as you have
access to multiple desks.

You can hit the refresh button to re-query the data - or set the auto refresh
on the tool bar.

We did not build Filter by Business Unit for multiple reasons:
- the expense to build the filter.
- it is easier to support if everyone is looking at the same thing.
- if there is a new business unit - you will see it.
- normally - there should not be more than a screen full of deals in error
state - once Petro Can/Suncor/Sunoco are set up - we will have a reasonable
number to look at - and you can sort by the business unit column.
- If you do want to filter - you may do so - by using the send to excel
feature - under tool bar option - file - dump to excel.

If you have any questions or problems - please call the SITARA hotline.

Attached find a term sheet that we are ready to send to Global Crossing.

As you know my team has been negotiating a deal for the sale of our dark fiber assets for cash and an obligation on the part of EBS to buy future services at market from the counterparty.  I am far down the road with Qwest, lagging with Level 3 and Global Crossing.  The terms proposed here for Global Crossing would upgrade their previous bid from "not even close" to "very competitive" but would still not guarantee a deal.  Global Crossing has some tough challenges (credit) that some others don't.

Notes for this Week's Report:

*  North American Gas has kept its overall average daily EOL deal count
steady at about 2,950 trades a day since January.  This is about 180 trades a
day less than the November average of 3,130, which is still the Life to Date
high.  The overall average daily EOL volumes have remained steady as well.

*  The East and Central Regions of North American Gas have been the main
reason EOL Gas transactions have remained steady.  The East Region has
increased its overall average daily EOL deal count by about 20% since
January, from 632 to 798 deals per day.  The Central Region has increased its
overall average daily EOL deal count by about 50% since January, from 676 to
1,018 deals per day.

*  US Power trading via EOL has now levelled off to average daily EOL Deal
Count of about 452 deals per day.   This is mostly up from 181 deals per day
in December, to 340 in January, to 449 in February.  In addition, the average
daily Non-EOL Deal Count has also levelled off at about 483 deals per day.
The average daily EOL volumes have remained fairly steady.

*  US East Power trading via EOL has now dropped off since February.  It has
decreased its average daily EOL Deal Count by about 13% since February, from
359 deals per day to 313.  In addition, the average daily Non-EOL Deal Count
has now decreased by about 7% since February, from 269 to 250 deals per day.
The average daily EOL volumes have remained steady.

*  UK Gas trading has continued to see a steady increase since December on
EOL.  They were averaging close to 51 transactions per day in December 2000.
Recently they have been climbing to 81 deals per day in January, 111 in
February, and now 167 in March.  This represents about a 227% increase.

*  LPG's has decreased its total monthly EOL deal count from a consistent 450
trades or so from November through January, to only 250 trades in the month
of February, and only about 84 trades so far in the month of March .  This
represents about a 62% decrease from previous months.  The total monthly EOL
volumes have decreased similarly as well.

*  Enron Metals trades done via EOL has increased since February, from a
daily average of 497 to a daily average of 629 for March.  This represents
about a 27% increase.  The average daily EOL volumes have increased as well.

We have several other Florida opportunities that are at about a 50%
probability (Corbett, Deerfield, Pompano, and South Dade). We also have
projects in Goergia (Hartwell and Athens) that are probably 70%, and
Louisiana (Calcasieu and St Charles) that are 50%. I would put Midway at 90%.
The non-Florida opportunities would be used to package with the turbines and
flip a la Pastoria. We have strong interest in Georgia in particular, and
have received a written offer from FPL to purchase the development assets of
Hartwell and Athens for $4.4 million (no equip. included).
I would presume we would put the turbines back on the market in Q1 of '02 if
we do not proceed with any Florida opportunities. I think the downside is
approximately $2 million per unit (given that that is our effective premium
being offered today), but that we have a natural hedge on this downside as we
have a high chance of recouping any downside by combining the turbines with
any of the development assets listed above (they have all been permitted for
7FAs, although not all permits have been received).

I am asking you on my behalf and on behalf of Rick Causey to make a keynote presentation
at the annual Energy Finance Conference at the University of Texas at Austin. The conference
is tentatively scheduled to take place on February 21 - 22, 2002. Depending on your calendar, the
conference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner
(February 21, 2002, Thursday) or lunch (February 22, 2002, Friday).
This annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business. The topics covered
in the past meetings  included applications of real options technology to the energy business, risk management
and the future of deregulation. The agenda of the last conference is attached for your review; the agenda
for the 2002 event is under development.
Given Enron's relationship with UT and our interest in the Energy Finance program,
a great source of highly skilled talent for our Analyst / Associate Program, we think that your participation
will benefit the company. The conference is widely attended by senior executives of other
energy companies and is an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and the
agenda for the future.

Here is the list for Friday's positions.  To give you an update on what the daily calcs are used for, information from RisktRAC and CAS is being pulled on an ad hoc basis to fulfill requests from both external and internal personnel/companies.  As such, books with any positions should be calced as often as possible.
Also for the 31st, my understanding after talking to several groups is that certain groups have only limited resources right now and will not be able to provide accurate calcs for the 31st before late this week or early next week.  Please keep me up to date on the status of your information.  Once all books have been calced, officialized, and exported (to Athena) for the 31st we will rerun VAR and produce a DPR.
Open questions:
Cindy - lets discuss what should be done for ECTRIC on an ongoing basis as well as for the 31st.
Kori - do any of the books listed with you as the BA have positions - if not we can inactivate them
Jeff - there are a couple of gas books that seem to have positions, NG-PR-OPT-PRC (which is inactive) and NG-PRICE-GDL.  Who can I get the status from for these?
Thanks
Shona

PS:  When you review the information regarding CAS - no position means no 3rd party position.  Since not all groups have deleted their intercompany positions, there may be books listed below as "no position" which do have VAR/P&L risk.

How are we handling this type of issue? Are we sending them a letter indicating that they still have to pay for gas we have already delivered?

Please allow me to take a moment to express our my gratitude to Enron for assisting us (my wife, 2 daughters and me) in our desperate time of need.  Although many in Houston were affected by Tropical Storm Allison to a degree worse than we, still we were in dire need of help.  Enron, the outstanding company that it is, came through for us.
My family and I have been displaced from our home, and the sum total of our worldly possessions now fit inside 1 half of a 2-car garage.  Enron has helped us begin to put our lives back together, and I can think of no more eloquent or appropriate way to express our gratitude than to simply say, "Thank you."
The immense pride I feel being a part of the most innovative company in the world has increased 10 fold.
My most sincere thanks,

Yesterday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved VA/HUD/Independent
Agencies appropriations bill (which funds EPA) and included legislative
language stating that EPA should harmonize the NOx SIP and 126 deadlines for
SIP submission and compliance.   As you may recall, under the NOx SIP Call
the courts have required states to submit SIPs to EPA by October 31, 2000,
and recently moved the deadline for sources to comply with the state plans to
May 2004.   While the Section 126 rule will be litigated this fall, the
courts have not moved the deadline for sources to comply with this federal
NOx regulation from May of 2003.

Industry supporters of this language are optimistic that this legislative
language increases the chances that the SIP Call and 126 rules will be
harmonized.  If the language passes, it will have the force of law --
depending on how forceful the final language is, EPA may be compelled to
harmonize the laws.  On the other hand, this also increases the visibility of
the language and could increase opposition to its inclusion in the
appropriations bill as the House/Senate Conference Committee considers the
bill.  The language was not in the House version of the bill, and the
Administration could weigh in with a veto threat that could scare off Senate
negotiators in the end.

This would be a significant development in NOx regulation, in that if this
language becomes law, we would have more certainty that generation sources
would not likely need to comply with NOx regulations until May 2004.  Right
now, industry still faces a May 2003 deadline for compliance with the 126
petitions, unless the litigation or this legislation changes things.

We will keep you posted as developments occur.

My only suggestion are as follows:
(1)  We need to be more explicit about the de-coupling of the assets from the
gas that is delivered to CES by ENA.  As such, I would recommend that we
expand Sections 4.1 and 4.2  to include a CES paper pool storage or bank
which gets credits (theoretical injections) and debits (theoretical
withdrawals).  The credits to the bank would be made in accordance with the
"Theoretical Storage Injection Schedule (TSIS)" as per 4.2 and Exhibit 2.
The debits to the bank would be made per the daily CES nominations on days
when the retail demand is greater than the daily purchase quantity defined on
Exhibit 1.  The one exception to this de-coupling is that all of the
debits/credits would be subject to operational constraints imposed by the Gas
Storage Contracts and the Gas Transportation Contracts.  The constraints
should only come into play with the debits, as the TSIS (which by definition
will be less than the daily MDIQ) would rarely be impacted by constraints.
At the end of the term, the bank balance and the physical storage balance
will need to be equal.  If not, provision needs to be made for a post term
true-up.
(2)  In the last sentence of Section 4.1, should the remedy for CES's failure
to notify in a timely manner be "penalties" or "ENA damages," which would
include both penalties and trading losses &/or opportunity costs?  I am not
certain, but I understood it to be the latter.

Also, please generate the west flow summary report at 6:15 am.  In addition, #22 West_2 (daily and historical) and #38 West_3 (daily and historical) which run before the 2nd cube refresh should be among the first report run after the 1st cube run because they will be the first reports accessed in the morning by Patti (roughly 5:30am).

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success.

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.

Talking points for Jean-Marie Messier, Chairman and CEO of Vivendi.

Blockbuster has had several meetings with Universal to obtain rights to
content for the video on demand (VOD) offering.  Blockbuster has proposed an
agreement to license product for both VHS/DVD rentals and the video on demand
offering.

The negotiations have stalled because Universal has not been willing to sign
any long-term agreements without Vivendi's support.

Blockbuster has refused to renew their agreement with Universal for VHS/DVD
rentals until Universal agrees to grant digital VOD rights.  This will be
detrimental to both parties.

We would like for Vivendi to communicate to Universal that they would support
a VOD agreement between Universal and Blockbuster for digital content
rights.  A conversation with Mr. Messier on this topic would be appreciated.

Elizabeth .  This response will be too late for your needs. I am assuming that the scope of the survey is to look at information technology tools that would enhance our effectiveness. If so, there are some tools that we used in South America and I do not know if we have an equivalent here.
a) Itinerary Lotus Notes data base. -  Very convenient. It lists every one with the contact information and the latest itinerary. It allows people on the road to make last minute changes.
b) Project document data base.-  This is in the Lotus Notes data base environment. It is a convenient place to find all related documents associated with a given project. (i.e. development of a power plant , or   a regulatory filing). Access is granted to those that need access to the "project documents"
c) Project task status.- My personal favorite.- It allows people cooperating on a project to communicate and keep track on related activities. Good tool for weekly to-do-list.  Access is given to those that are working on the project. Lotus Notes environment.  Example - NERC related tasks.

Chris,

I recently found out that Questar posts a Clay Basin storage inventory in html on their website.  The link is http://www.questarpipeline.com/html/qpc_capacity.html.  We will need to start scraping this balance, specifically the "Total Clay Basin Annual Working Gas" and "Total clay Basin Reservoir Inventory".  This does not impact the storage Inventory issue that we've previously discussed, since this balance is currently a manual entry point, and will continue to be even after we start scraping these points.  Please give me a realistic estimate of when we can begin scraping this data.  We will need to create DRN's for both of these points.  Clearly, in terms of priorities, working out the bigger storage inventory balance issue is much higher priority.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Great.  As we discussed, we'll need the final query to list all counterparties for each product with net quantities stated for each day (dates listed as column headings) of the current month.  Ideally, the query will be executed daily and posted in html or xls on the Gas Fundy website.

Davis' criticism of Texas misdirected, report finds
Lynda Gledhill, Mark Martin, Chronicle Staff Writers
Tuesday, July 10, 2001
2001 San Francisco Chronicle

Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share of the money went elsewhere.
Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest.
The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas.
Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting against power firms in his home state. "What's going on here, pure and simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most of them, incidentally, located in Texas," he said in May.
Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators who have also gouged California.
"Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind," said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman.
The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state Department of Water Resources detailing $7.2 billion in power purchases from Jan. 17 through the end of May.
About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are made a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually used.
Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropped as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of events that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recover from customers.
The numbers released yesterday show that Texas companies weren't alone in receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2 billion went to Mirant, an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to turn over documents subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its investigation into alleged market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt proceedings.
Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis. Powerex,
a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC Hydro, received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged higher average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 million.

With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please

This is a follow-up to my e-mail sent June 23rd. We are gearing up to release
the above referenced Product.

Matt - I need a Sigma Factor please; there will be one Product Type for each
of the 'flexible' scenario's (i) not less than three day, not less than 5
day, not less than 10 day:

Country: USA
Commodity: US Nat Gas
UoM:  MMBtu
Product Type: Physical Index (Flexible)

We are close to a final draft f the Product Description that will hit the
website. The laymans description of the Product is as follows:

Buyer and Seller exchange gas during the month of June 2000.

Seller receives 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 300,000 total MMBtu) at TCO Pool
Index.

Buyer has the right to notify Seller of when Buyer wants to take delivery
during the month of June, and may take delivery in one of three forms: not
less than 3-day delivery, not less than 5-day delivery, or not less than
10-day delivery (depending on Product Type). The gas nominated for each such
day would be between Zero and not greater than the percentage of the total
300,000 MMBtu based on the number of days of 'flexibility' (i.e.; Buyer
chooses 5 days for nomination, Seller would deliver not more than 20% of the
300,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100%). Buyer pays
TCO Pool Index PLUS a premium.

While the product Description on the website accounts for both the month-long
delivery to the Seller and the 'flexibility' of the Buyer, the product should
be entered into the downstream processes, settled and confirmed as two
different products. This is necessary in order to give us the protection
against non-performance that the GTC's and master contracts support.

Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyone I may have missed.

One month later, it will make more specific recommendations as to possible changes that could be made to NSR.

While EPA's review includes long-term options like complete legislative overhaul of the Clean Air Act, it is likely that it will consider many of the more short term options available to it under existing regulatory/administrative authority.

In the process of developing its recommendations, EPA published a "Background Paper" and opened a docket soliciting public comment on a broad range of issues pertaining to NSR.  EPA has also held public hearings and numerous stakeholder meetings.  Enron participated in stakeholder meetings, and also submitted written comments -- as part of several organizations (EPSA, Clean Power Group, INGAA) and individually.

The attached Enron comments, submitted last Friday, July 27,  reflect input from numerous commercial sources.  NSR impacts a number of commercial interests, including:
development, siting and finance of new power plants;
origination activities with customers seeking to upgrade, expand or modify power facilities;
trading/risk management for power, gas, coal, emissions allowances;
finance/deployment of emissions control technologies;
industrial markets such as forest products, steel, refining/chemicals
power generation and natural gas pipeline operations

We will continue to have opportunities to provide input into the process through EPA and the Administration, and would welcome further comments or examples of impact on our businesses.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or would like additional background information.  I will keep you posted on the progress of this issue as developments occur.

Thank you, Corp!

Friday's United Way Appreciation Lunch was great fun.  Team Corp and their amazing Lego structure, which won an award for being the Most United, made us proud.  Congratulations to all of the team members: Ed Coats, David Gorte, Bob Hermann, Amy Kim, Mark Palmer, Greek Rice, Chip Schneider, Jim Steffes, Mike Terraso, Dennis Vegas.

Now let's show all of Enron that Corp employees are as generous as we are bold, smart, ambitious and innovative.

At Friday's lunch, we received a little challenge from Stan Horton, CEO of Enron Transportation Services. He's betting homemade cookies that by close of business on Monday, August 13 ETS will have a higher percentage of their overall goal than all of the other business units. I do not want to be up all night baking chocolate chip cookies for Stan, so I think we need to accept his challenge and blow ETS, EWS and EES out of the water!

The good news is that to date, Corp has raised $506,743, which is about 65% of our total goal of $785,000.

The bad news is that only 21% of Corp employees have participated in the campaign so far.

If you are part of that 21% that has already given to the United Way, THANK YOU.  Your contribution makes a difference right here in our community.

If you haven't made your contribution, you still have time.  Please log on to <http://home.enron.com> and click on the United Way link today to make your contribution.  You'll need your GIS number to make your contribution.  Your GIS number is an eight-digit number that starts with a 9.

If you don't have your GIS number and password or need assistance with keying in your contribution, please call Kathy Mayfield at ext. 3-3264.

Please remember that contributions made last year don't automatically roll over to this year.  You'll need to log on and make another contribution this year.

Your contribution to the United Way has an impact on one out of every two lives in the Houston community.  Don't miss the opportunity to play a role in Building Houston's Future.

1. US is under attack.  We are in state of emergency.  Casualties are likely to be in the thousands. Two US "critical infrastructures"--transportation and finance--the cornerstones of the US economy have been severely damaged.

2. Discount all gossip.  Responsibility will be put on many groups and many groups will claim responsibility.  There are no facts at this time.

3. Nonetheless, there are a limited number of terrorist groups that could coordinate an attack with this many targets and this level of sophisticaton.  Indeed, it is likely that a state sponsor of some kind would be required to provide financial and intelligence support for such an attack.

4. It is virtually certain that these groups or countries are based in the Middle East.  It is almost equally certain that a massive US response against a Middle Eastern target is forthcoming. There will be enormous domestic political pressure on the Bush Administration for a vengeance attack. This will be at least partially offset by a reluctance to further inflame Arab radicalism in the Middle East and Persian Gulf.

5. As mentioned above, in addition to the horrendous human cost, there are economic and market consequences:

Oil- IPE and NYMEX are closed.  Oil futures will of course react strongly to the dramatic uptick in Middle Eastern uncertainty.

Equities- General flight to quality.  Investors are selling equities and putting funds into cash.  Many major brokerages and trading firms have been wiped out in the WTC collapse. It will take some time--days or weeks--for these firms to restore operations.

Currencies- Swiss Franc and US dollar will benefit from flight to quality.

Shipping- major ports and border crossing closed, surrounding areas jammed with traffic.  Impact on all commodities--steel, lumber, pulp/paper, crude/products shipments, LNG, etc.  Ships at sea will back up, affecting pipeline deliveries.  Freight impacted by road chaos in major US cities.

Metals- gold/platinum benefit from flight to quality.

We will update as soon as we get information.

Under the new agreement, MCI WorldCom will provide long distance services, calling cards and data services to Enron locations worldwide. Although the initial implementation process will begin immediately, more detailed information on how existing telecommunication services will be transferred to MCI will be distributed within the next 30 days.

With the execution of this agreement, Enron will receive savings of $18 million over the next two years.

The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an "Emissions Strategy Meeting" in mid-May to discuss global emissions issues -- such as climate change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and explore some of the potential business opportunities for Enron commercial groups.

The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies for Enron in both the short and long term.  We invite you or a member of your group to participate in this important strategic discussion.

Our target dates are May 16, 17 or 18 in Houston (likely time is 10 a.m. - 12 p.m.).  Please respond immediately with your best available dates so we can finalize our arrangements.

Please review the attached invitation and preliminary agenda.  If you have any questions or suggestions in advance of the meeting, do not hesitate to contact me of Jeff Keeler.

I've attached a memo prepared by Carl Imparato that summarizes the discussion
that we recommend be included in a filing with FERC that lists the top
priorities for fixing the California market.  (Actually, there are 7 topics
on the list.  Item 6 is a list of things that FERC should not do, and item 7
will not be pursued.)

Our thematic approach is to explain that the California model worked fairly
well until this summer when demand outstripped available resources, which, in
combination with wrong-headed CPUC policies (such as disincentives against
hedging), AB 1890 mandates, and ISO implementation decisions, caused prices
to spike.  Thus, the solution is to fix these policies, not to eschew the
de-centralized California approach in favor of a POOLCO model favored by
certain entities.

We hope to have a good draft to circulate by mid-week next week.  Please let
me know as soon as possible if you oppose including any of these issues in
the paper, or the priority ranking or thematic approach discussed above.

PLEASE USE THE POSITION MANAGER HOME BUTTON.

When using the SITARA Position Manager,  and you drill down to view details
or change the dates, the Position Manager keeps
all your views running in the background.  This feature allows you to use the
BACK and FORWARD buttons to keep your views running.
On the downside, if you keep these views running but do not really intend to
go BACK to look at them, the system and your PC are working harder
to keep all the old views active and updated.

The HOME button sends you back to your default view - the first view you had
up when you hit apply.  By clicking this button, your
Position Manager will clear out the old views the next time you drill in.
This is the only way to clear out the old views that you no longer need.

If you do not use the HOME key, and keep drilling in and changing the dates,
the Position Manager is still keeping all the your views for
the day running in the backgound.

What we have found is by the end of the day, a user that does not clear out
the old views can have well over 30 views open, which is like having
30 Position Managers up on your PC.  When that user closes down, the position
gets locked up for a while as it tries to clear out all the old views.

We will be making some changes soon to that should resolve this issue as far
as the SITARA machine is concerned; however, your PC may still be
slow with excessive unneccessary views open.   We could make a change to
limit the number of active views you can have open, but at this time
I am not sure that is necessary; regardless, in the mean time, please
remember to use your HOME button.

Although the contract with Adventis has been terminated by D.Cox via telephone, Partha Ghosh continues to try to facilitate the AT&T - Enron relationship.

I continue to believe that there is no reason that you can not have a direct relationship with Dave Dorman to pursue opportunities at a high level.  I have always encouraged a direct call from you to D.Dorman to find out if we can wean ourselves from Adventis.

I understand that you have a call scheduled today with D.Dorman I would like to take the opportunity to get a gut check on the previous deal if you think it is appropriate.
**EOM**
DOWNSPEAK
**START**
Talking Points:


Previous Deals Proposed

We previously proposed a transaction to establish a JV which would pursue the wholesale intermediation market for long haul bandwidth (see attached draft).

You seemed interested in our proposal but we have had difficulty in getting a follow up meeting to confirm your interest and get your thoughts on the proposal.

In the meantime, through Adventis, we proposed a different structure where AT&T would buy Enron's longhaul network and in exchange Enron would take back a take or pay (see attached draft).  In our view, it's really the same deal but instead of AT&T receiving value through an equity interest in a JV, AT&T would receive value through the take of pay.  The deal really accomplishes the same thing for us.


The Strategy Behind the Deals Proposed

EBS is really an acquisition for Enron that came with the purchase of Portland General Electric.  The communications company of PGE was going down the road of all of the other fiber over builders in the marketplace in that it intended to build out its own network.

We have repositioning that company over the last 12 - 18 months so that it fits better with the Enron business model of trading and intermediation.  Part of this process likely includes reducing of most of out long haul positions to better facilitate intermediating the long haul market as opposed to  build, own and operate in it. The deals proposed to AT&T would assist accomplish this repositioning of EBS.

Future Communications

Previously we have spent much of our time communicating to you through Adventis.  This has been a challenging process for us.  Is it possible to establish a direct high level relationship with AT&T especially at the President (D.Dorman) to CEO (J.Skilling) level.

PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off.  The numbers in the Test Sheet
for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for
February 5th.  I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's
website for the 5th.  Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however,
sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.

Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.  It appears the Test
Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.  However, the
website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as
late as 7 am (we are not sure why).  I understand you may pull the numbers
from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers
earlier.

TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.  We pull
the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.  It
looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.  They
differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the
other.  To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet.

PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.  The numbers for February
6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.  Is this a reporting or a
scrubbing problem?  It is possible you are pulling the data from the website
before they update it with the next day's data.  We manually type these
numbers in.  If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers would
not be in when this report is run.

El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plant
receipts.  The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas because
I don't think this is a cycle problem.

General - The "Difference" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle
for the current with the final cycle of the previous day.  This can cause
intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day
fluxuations.  Any "Difference" column should compare identical cycles.  I
suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day
and the previous day.  This way we can compare identical cycles as well as
pick up any intraday fluxuations.

As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report.
These notes should give us a great place to start.  I look forward to getting
this report ready to use.

Just a couple of suggested changes to both.

There is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership structure of the entity.  Enron had previously announced that the entiy would be 51% New Owner and 49% Enron.  We need to ensure this message is corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100% UBS owner.


On the release for UBSWenergy.com - we do intend to trade physical gas and power immediately initially at least in the areas we can, so I have removed that sentence.

Do you need all of the commercial  MD titles or is Kevin picked out for a particular reason?

Thanks

Jeff,

London
I would like to have turrets for my guys in London.  As a small group where everyone is learning and involved in everything it helps for them to communicate better internally and externally.  I have been told by London that our phone usage does not warrant turrets.  I don't want that to be the basis on which the decision is made.  Paul and I believe they are necessary to the business, our cost structure is reasonable and will improve over time.

I want the phones and I want to be able to operate the business as we see fit.  If London has a bloated cost structure that is their issue and I don't want them to make it mine.

USA Allocations
I met with IT on Monday regarding my allocations and I still find them to be unacceptable.  For example, my overhead allocation is approximately half of Dan's, yet we have about 25% of the people working on our system.  I will discuss with Brent, but wanted you to know.

I have created a directory (O:\research\common\projects\options\McLib)
to hold our Monte-Carlo models we developed in the past.

I have the following MC models:

1. Asian option with two-point vol structure
2. Asian barrier option
3. Asian spread option
4. Time spread option
5. Asian Digital option

Do we want to include models using American Monte-Carlo ?
I have

1. American Spread Option
2. Option on Min or Max of  n assets with n as an input
3. Omicron option model with 3 price processes

I suggest that all of us save a copy of Monte-Carlo models in this directory,
from these,

During the March 7 meeting we reviewed the 'Proposed Accounting Timeline', which is part of the Project Update dated March 7, 2002.  The proposed timeline at the bottom of the page shows that 'Imbalance Trading Ends' on the 16th calendar day of the month.

GISB Standard 2.3.41 states that imbalance trading should be allowed through at least the 17th business day of the month.  The language of the standard is as follows:

"Standard 2.3.41 -- Transportation Service Providers should provide the ability to post and trade imbalances until at least the close of the seventeenth business day of the month."

This timing will need to be incorporated into the timeline.

The note below from Kevin describes the communications issues we are having with the MOPS system. Apparently we are hopeful that comm will be re-established, on a temporary basis, this afternoon. We have also checked into the device types on the MOPS system to determine how much data can be stored locally. As you can see from the attached file, there are 7 of the 29 field units that will only store up to 7 days of hourly data. After that, we would begin losing data. To avoid losing data, if communication isn't available, we would have to collect locally using laptops.

RSVP REQUESTED -- RSVP REQUESTED

You are invited to participate in a Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion on November 20 to explore commercial opportunities related to greenhouse gas emissions markets.  Several groups within Enron are working to monetize and integrate greenhouse-gas reduction benefits into their deals, as well as take advantage of greenhouse gas regulatory and incentive-based programs for origination, project development and risk management.

The aim of the meeting is discussion -- with minimal formal presentations.  We seek reactions to possible greenhouse gas commercial models; identification of barriers to market entry (and solutions); and ways that commercial groups across the company can enhance each other's capabilities to achieve commercial targets.

Given the range and varying circumstances under which current greenhouse gas emissions transactions are occurring, Enron business groups should:

begin to capture (define ownership and package) internal greenhouse gas reductions,
look for opportunities to integrate greenhouse gas emissions concerns into existing risk management products, and
Enron assets that are significant greenhouse gas emissions sources, should assess and manage exposures.

I usually don't forward these but this one is particularly frightening
to
me....

Don't go to the bathroom on October 28th. CIA intelligence reports
that a major plot is planned for that day. Anyone who takes a poop
on the 28th will be bitten on the ass by an alligator. Reports
indicate that organized groups of alligators are planning to rise
up into unsuspecting American's toilet bowls and bite them when
they are doing their dirty business.

I usually don't send emails like this, but I got this information
from a reliable source. It came from a friend of a friend whose
cousin is dating this girl whose brother knows this guy whose wife
knows this lady whose husband buys hotdogs from this guy who knows
a shoeshine guy who shines the shoes of a mailroom worker who has
a friend who's drug dealer sells drugs to another mailroom worker
who works in the CIA building. He apparently overheard two guys
talking in the bathroom about alligators and came to the
conclusion that we are going to be attacked. So it must be true.

It currently looks like we will not have any wire requests today for power prepayments.

East Power - We are currently working with PJM and NEPOOL to come to a payment resolution to remain active and current in those two markets, and will not have any need for a wire transfers today (the earliest we will need may be tomorrow depending upon form of resolution).  Additionally, given the post Christmas market conditions and lack of liquidity (and staffing needs in companies other than Enron), Kevin and Dana were not able to execute any bilateral prepay deals for the regions outside PJM and NEPOOL.  They will be continuing to push these deals for the next several days, but realistically, it may be next week before we can actually pull these off.

West Power -  We will have tomorrow a detailed prepay list and wire requests for the first week of January.

Hello!

As you know, Terry Franklin is beginning to transition into the Appalachian
coordination role.  We spent time today with Bryce Baxter, Wade Price, and
Gloria Barkowsky to determine how best to attack the current issues.

As Job 1, we determined that Terry's time is best utilized on transportation
contract set-up.  Of course, Terry "job description" includes other tasks,
but at this time, this is her #1 focus.  We decided this for the following
reasons:

1.  Deals cannot be pathed without transportation contracts set-up in SITARA.
2.  In order to pay the producers and the pipeline, the deals must be pathed
by Logistics (zero volume paths), and volumes must by allocated (based on
actuals) by Gloria Barkowsky, Volume Mgmt.
3.  Wade Price, Settlements, is focused on setting up SITARA deals for
producer wellhead purchases.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Thanks,
Carrie

Both TXU Electric and Dayton Power are slightly in-the-money physical power positions.  If there is a chance that we determine that these are not valid terminations, we need to begin to reschedule power, I assume?  Given they are in the money, can we complete our legal review quickly.

Professor Howard Stevenson (Harvard Bus. Sch. - Entrepreneurship) will be in Houston on the 14th or 15th of June to discuss a new case study that HBS is preparing entitled "Modern Giants".  Professor Stevenson would like to feature Enron in the case and has requested a brief meeting with you followed up with lunch with any available HBS alumni.

I have attached an email from the HBS Director of Development who contacted me, which summarizes the proposed case and provides a bio on Professor Stevenson.  Are you interested in Enron's participation in the Case Study? and would you be available for a brief meeting with Professor Stevenson - and possibly lunch?

In my view, we need to refresh the Enron story being told through HBS Case Studies.  The Dabhol Power Case (still being used) is dated and does not reflect our business strategy.  I have asked HBS to contact your office directly to check your availability.

Tom,

Got your voicemail and e-mail.  Below is the explanation I received from Corp Benefits on the price for your recent activity through Hewitt.  Will get back with you on final resolution to this problem before the end of the week. Hopefully will have an answer for you by  Thursday, no later than Friday.

Thanks again for your patience.

Response:
Irma,

I've just verified the following information from Hewitt:

On Tuesday, 11/20/01, Mr. Martin spoke with a rep at Hewitt to roll over his ESOP balance into the Savings Plan.  He made this request at 4:28 p.m.  Since this was after the market close (which was 3:00 p.m.), his transaction did not occur until the 11/21/01 update.  He rolled 1,522.00 shares over to the Savings Plan, at a total value of $7,625.22, which is $5.01 per share.  That value was posted to the Enron Corp. stock fund in the Savings Plan the evening of 11/21/01.  They were in his Savings Plan account as of the morning of 11/22/01 (which was Thanksgiving Day).
On 11/23/01, Mr. Martin transferred his holdings in the Enron Corp. Stock Fund to the Stable Asset fund.  He did this transfer at 2:22 p.m., via the web site.  However, on 11/23/01, the stock exchange closed at 1:00 p.m., instead of the usual 3:00 p.m.  Consequently, the transfer was not effective on Friday, 11/23/01, but occurred on the next business day, which was 11/26/01.  At the time of the transfer, the value in the Stock Fund was $6,113.26, which was equal to $4.01 per share.

Thanks again for your patience and cooperation.

Please give me your thoughts on the attached proposal to resolve the "dangling chads" with AEP.  I have attached the proposal and a "value analysis" of the proposal, both of which I propose to send to AEP.  The key benefits of the proposal from Enron's perspective are the following:
1.	Removes us from the vagueness and uncapped exposure of the Ducote deal with Entex for additional costs.  AEP can capture the economics of future gas deliveres to Entex associated with this capital expenditure.
2.	Captures the leverage that AEP will have in the Entex audit.  I think for ENA to pursue Entex would be difficult/time consuming and may lead to a tortious interference suit from AEP.
3.	Gives up the interest payment we think AEP owes us.  This is true value we are giving up, but do we really want to fight with AEP in court over this (to the extent they are not bluffing)?
4.	Removes us from having to process imbalances - saving manpower costs and further removing us from hassles with AEP.  AEP is better able to capture value from these imbalances then we are, since they have the pipe.
5.	Gets us out of the Coastline law suit.  I'm pretty sure Coastline is at least owed the $1.4MM that we would contribute.  AEP has a chance to minimize any further costs, which are capped by the value of the claim at a further $2.2MM.
Please do not circulate this.

Paulo,

I have talked to Vince and Stinson about the Credit Model enhancement and
extension.

We will pull other reseource for the Potential Exposure model, so you will be
relieved from this more
challenging part of the project.

Due to our limited manpower, everyone is overloaded with multiple tasks.  So
we still think you
are the best person for the short term project which is adding the asian
option to the existing model (ask
Amitava for help if needed).

I do not mind if you want to re-negotiate with the customer about the
delivery date, but keep in mind that EES
has done deals requiring the asian option valuation in the credit model.

I know you are all being forwarded the messages on the blood drive and the contribution matching by Enron (2 for 1) to charitable organizations in NY.  I know we ask a lot of our employees and sometimes all these "contributions" seem overwhelming.  I personally ask each of you to take time this week in your own personal way to give thanks.  We have group members who were close to harms way and the Central Region has family members potentially lost in this tragedy.
The best way I know to encourage an official "time-out"  is to ensure you all start your weekends with your families starting at noon today.  Officially Central Origination/enovate are closed this afternoon.

Find below a spreadsheet with my very rough calculation of the value of
credit support for MG and PaperCo.

My approach is as follows:

1.   Assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps.
2.   Spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors.
3.   Calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap (the
default option)  using Black's formula.
4.   Treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows.  That is
treat this value just like you would an annuity stream.  By discounting back
this stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk-reduced
rate, I find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the two
NPV's.

Please give your comments, especially if this makes no sense to you.

Attached is the press release concerning the 1:00 p.m. PST teleconference today.  The press release indicates the RTO filing will be available on the web site prior to the teleconference.

<Susan.J.Mara@enron.com> 06/01/01 02:22PM >>>

From my sources:

CA ISO is filing jointly with SCE and SDG&E.  The comments begin with a
tyrade that FERC has no right to condition price caps on joining an RTO.
Apparently, they weakly support regional organizations and note agreement
to work with the other RTOs that are now forming.

PG&E is filing separate comments "because of its bankruptcy." PG&E will
note concern about the CA ISO "independence" and talks about other RTOs as
potentially good options.

The CPUC ordered and berated PG&E to file its comments with the CPUC BEFORE
submitting them to FERC.  PG&E initially protested, but was threatened with
fines.  It finally filed yesterday under seal.

Bottomline:

I believe that the joint ISO/IOU filing is structured to provide the
minimal needed to meet the FERC test. Therefore, FERC's price caps will
remain in effect.

Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.
On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the "preferred" distribution  relative to the bottom category for " commercial support" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a "preferred" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.
Thanks.

For the next few days, we will be reporting only positions, maturity gap, & VAR for the DPR.  We expect to be reporting P&L for ENA again probably by the middle of next week.

The 11/30 DPR is still listed on the ERV as preliminary, as there are still a couple small items outstanding.  The 12/3 and 12/4 DPRs should be out by tomorrow.  We are currently experiencing some IT issues related to position reporting which have prevented the reporting of these days.  I expect the issue to be resolved by the middle of the afternoon today and we will report shortly thereafter.

Dana, thank you for the offer. I will review your proposal and respond quickly.  As you implied in your offer, it is important that we complete this transaction very quickly if we are going to do it.  My initial thoughts are that we would need to receive the payments over a maximum of 12 months not 24 months.  In addition, as we are using the assets to manage an unrelated delivery obligation I will need to either determine another way to manage that delivery without the VNG assets or transfer the short position to you.  I do believe that given the details of this delivery obligation you will see it as a positive value to you.
I will provide an official response asap. I suggest that we consider a time on Wed or Thur of this week to get together for discussion.

I know things have been very difficult but this is a huge step in moving us forward.  Unfortunately I do not see things getting much easier during our start-up months but I really do believe it will all be worth it and hopefully we'll have a lot of fun along the way.

We are positioning ourselves to release a new Product Type that we will refer
to as a Flexible Physical Gas product. Legal is in the process of drafting a
GTC and Product Type description that will be used with this Product Type. I
will start the building process once Legal provides the GTC and Product Type
description; but in the interim, here's a broadstroke description of how the
transaction works:

Party A and Party B exchange gas during the month of June 2000.

Party A buys 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 300,000 total MMBtu) at TCO Pool Index

Party B has the right to notify Party A of when Party B wants to take
delivery during the month of June, and may take delivery in one of three
forms: 3-day delivery, 5-day delivery, or 10-day delivery. The gas nominated
for each such day would be a percentage of the total 300,000 MMBtu (i.e.; If
Party B chooses 5 days for nomination, Party A would deliver 20% of the
300,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100%).  Party B pay
TCO Pool Index PLUS a premium.

I understand that this type of transaction is currently done
over-the-counter. Scott Mills has previously issued an explanatory e-mail of
Sitara concerns and we should begin to address those issues.

Bjorn - if you could ask someone to prepare a Sigma Factor in advance, then
my turn around time to for the Product Type should be reduced. Also, due to
the varying 'optionality', do you think these three different products will
require three different Product Types?

Please feel free to call if you have any questions.

BREAKING NEWS!

GOD OVERRULES SUPREME COURT VERDICT
Bush to be smitten later today

(Vatican) In a stunning development this morning, God invoked the "one
nation,
under God" clause of the Pledge of Allegiance to overrule Tuesday night's
Supreme Court decision that handed the White House to George Bush.
"I'm not sure where the Supreme Court gets off," God said this morning on
a
rare Today Show appearance, "but I'm sure as hell not going to lie back
and
let
Bush get away with this nonsense." "I've watched analysts argue for weeks
now
that the exact vote count in Florida 'will never be known.' Well, I'm God
and I
DO know exactly who voted for whom. Let's cut to the chase: Gore won
Florida
by
exactly 20,219 votes."

Shocking political analysts and pundits, God's unexpected verdict
overrules
the
official Electoral College tally and awards Florida to Al Gore, giving him
a
289-246 victory. The Bush campaign is analyzing God's Word for possible
grounds
for appeal.

"God's ruling is a classic over-reach," argued Bush campaign strategist
Jim
Baker. "Clearly, a divine intervention in a U.S. Presidential Election is
unprecedented, unjust, and goes against the constitution of the state of
Florida."

"Jim Baker's a jackass," God responded. "He's got some surprises ahead of
him,
let me tell you. HOT ones, if you know what I mean." God, who provided the
exact
vote counts for every Florida precinct, explained that bad balloting
machinery
and voter confusion were no grounds to give the White House to "a friggin'
idiot." "Look, only 612 people in Palm Beach County voted for Buchanan.
Get
real! The rest meant to vote for Gore. Don't believe me? I'll name them:
Anderson, Pete; Anderson, Sam, Jr.; Arthur, James; Barnhardt, Ron..."

Our Lord then went on to note that he was displeased with George W. Bush's
prideful ways and announced that he would officially smite him today. In
an
act
of wrath unlike any reported since the Book of Job, God has taken all of
Bush's
goats and livestock, stripped him of his wealth and possessions, sold his
family
into slavery, forced the former presidential candidate into hard labor in
a
salt
mine, and afflicted him with deep boils.

Dick Cheney will reportedly receive leprosy.

Attached is the second draft of Enron's comments to FERC on ICAP.  The structure of the paper is summarised below:

1.  RTO's are a positive step forward for the industry.
2.  Spot markets are a necessary part of RTO development to ensure that the RTO can manage real time realiability.
3.  A well functioning spot market eliminates the need for separate capacity type products such as ICAP, reserve margin (i.e. it achieves the objectives of iCap).  The paper incorporates theoretical and emperical evidence from other sectors of the economy and deregulation in other parts of the world to support this conclusion.
4.  During the transition from a regulated environment to RTO's there may be a 'political' need for ICAP.  Specifically states that any interim proposal should be limited to 2 years after RTO implementation.
5.  If that is the case, the paper sets out the two common theoretical platforms which can be used as a basis for ICAP.
6.  Proposes two options based on the theroetical platforms.

We would appreciate input on two issues.

Firstly, Enron needs to make a decision on whether to limit our position to reliance on spot markets (i.e. don't suggest an interim solution).  While this is attractive, it is unlikely that Enron will get support from other participants (ICAP payments subsidize generation investment so no support from IPP's and consumers are not as confident as Enron that competitive markets will maintain reliability so they will want to sustain ICAP).

Secondly, drafting comments on the paper generally.  Please note that the final section, that proposes the Enron solution, requires substantial redrafting which will be done if the consensus is to propose such a solution.

A final draft will be sent out on the morning of Tuesday 10/16, the paper will be filed Wednesday.

regards
Mike ext. 57634

PS.  i don't want to sway opinion but i thought it may be useful to state my view.  I think that we concentrate on the rationale supporting RTO's and effective spot markets as mechanisms that achieve the goals of ICAP (i.e A spot market is Enrons solution).  Instead of proposing specific ICAP related solutions, we state that if others have different views, these should be debated in a specific FERC forum and any resulting separate iCap proposal if implemented should be interim in nature and minimise spot market distortions....

The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, issued a ruling today on the EPA Section 126 Rule.  (As brief background, the 126 Rule would have required compliance with more stringent summer-season NOx caps starting in May 2003 in several northeast and Midwest states)

The Order states:

"It is Ordered that EPA's Section 126 Rule is remanded as to all cogenerators, but vacated only as to those cogenerators classified as electric generating units ("EGUs") under the rule that supply equal to or less than one third of their potential capacity or equal to or less than 25 MW to the grid for sale per year."   Translation:  This part of the order appears to "vacate" or completely throw out the 126 rule for small cogen units (under 25 MW) or cogen units selling less than 1/3 into the grid.   For all other cogenerators, the court remands the rule to EPA for re-working, consistent with some of the court's earlier objections about EPA's handling of cogens.   Impact:  EPA will need to go back and formulate rules for cogens altogether, so there is currently no NOx compliance schedule in place for cogen units.   EPA will need to start from scratch for smaller cogens.

"It is Further ordered that as of May 15, 2001, the date of this court's decision, the three-year compliance period for emissions limitations applicable to EGUs under the Section 126 Rule is tolled, pending EPA's resolution of the remand of EGU growth factors ordered by this court."  Translation:  This more significant part of the order "tolls" -- or puts on hold -- compliance with the 126 Rule for ALL ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS (EGUs) until EPA resolves EGU growth factor issues that the court identified in its May 15, 2001 ruling.

Impact:  The practical effect of this part of the order will be to delay implementation of the Section 126 Rule until May 2004, when the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulation is scheduled to go into effect.   The EPA will not be able to re-issue its Section 126 rules in a time frame that would require compliance before May 2004.  The NOx SIP Call would have supplanted the Section 126 Rule in May 2004 anyway -- what this ruling does is take away some of the uncertainty that existed for the May to September 2003 period (original effective date of the Section 126).   This means that generators in states not covered already by existing NOx trading programs (OTR NOx program) will have another year to comply.

I will forward any more detailed legal analysis as I receive it, but this is the latest news.

Please call if you have any questions.

All of you continue to play a key role in the success of the sale of the
Peakers, LVI & II and Pastoria.  A number of different parties are currently
reviewing the book. Since we haven't had a chance to gather as a group
recently, I thought it might be beneficial to send out an email highlighting
the schedule over the next several weeks and months.
This week and next, we will be finalizing the due diligence room, the terms
of the purchase and sale agreements (PSA), the management presentation and a
lot of other stuff.  First round bids due a week from this Friday, on Sept.
29.    The week of Oct. 2,  we will be notifying those bidders that will
advance to Round 2 and we will be sending out the PSA.  The week of Oct. 9,
the real fun will begin with management presentations, due diligence room
opening and site visits.  The key people involved in these activities should
work to keep their schedules as flexible as possible from Oct. 9 - Nov 3. We
need to think about who can do plant tours, give presentations, etc given
that the most logical people may be giving the management presentation,
answering questions, and/or unavailable to lead the plant tour.  It is our
hope and expectations that we will have multiple bidders to juggle in this
process.  It is going to be a balancing act and I encourage everyone to begin
to think through people and process.  The schedule then has us selecting our
preferred purchaser(s) the week of Nov. 6, with a December 18, 2000 closing!
I believe we have identified and dealt with many of the legal, accounting,
tax and financing (unwind) issues surrounding the sale.  If people are aware
of other related issues, please let me know so that we can deal with them
ASAP.
Thanks again for everyone's help thus far.  If by chance you don't have a

Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee asked Enron to support the Congressional Black Caucus
"energy" field trip trip to Houston on Jun 28-30, 2001.  She said was going
to call Ken Lay, but Rosalee has not taken a call.

API has been asked to coordinate the meeting and they have hired a event
planning firm.  Jackson Lee has made it clear she wants Enron involved even
thought were are not APIMembers.  API would like to bring the CBC to the
Enron trading floor and gas control room.   Jackson Lee would also like to
have Ken Lay attend a roundtable discussion on June 29. There will be several
lavish social events which we will be inivited to attend.   We will also be
asked to contribute to the trip.....my guess is that we are looking at over
$40,000.

Jim Ford at API is coordinating the trip.  He will be in contact with me next
week with more information.

Sorry the info. is so sketchy, but that is all there is so far.

A.	Market Updates

U.S. Markets

US equity markets are closed today but may open Friday. NYSE/NASDAQ/AMEX officials will reconvene later today to decide on restart.
Chicago markets  (CBOT/CME) closed early at 1:00pm CDT, CBOT electronic a/c/e trading expected to resume tonight for grains, and resumption of all commodities under consideration.
NYMEX: still closed, electronic Access trading planned to open later tonight (start time still under consideration)
In equity news, frightened travelers are expected to avoid planes once carriers resume flying, prompting Standard & Poor's to consider cutting the long-term credit ratings of all U.S. airlines, British Airways and Air Canada. That would raise borrowing costs and worsen the industry's least profitable year in a decade. The losses at U.S. airlines, until this week predicted to reach $2.6 billion, may now rival the $4.8 billion loss of 1992.
In Europe, the four biggest airlines -- British Airways, Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Air France SA and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV -- will all now post a full-year loss due to their reliance on profits from the trans-Atlantic market.
In Asia, services to and from the U.S. contribute 10 percent to 20 percent of revenue at Cathay Pacific Airways and Singapore Airlines Ltd. Some $3.8 billion was wiped off the market value of airlines based in Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and other Asian capitals in two days.  The plunge in stocks reduced the value of Asia's eight biggest carriers by about 14 percent.

B.	Transportation/Infrastructure Updates

Air Travel
145 domestic airports have now been cleared to reopen, though Logan International Airport will remain closed indefinitely, despite the Federal Aviation Authority's decision to open U.S. airspace for commercial airplanes.
At least some regularly scheduled United Airlines flights are expected to begin at 7 p.m. EDT Thursday, and some scheduled flights on American Airlines and TWA after 4 p.m. EDT.  Delta Air Lines said "very limited operations" would start sometime after noon EDT Thursday. Continental has canceled all regularly scheduled flights for the day, but planned to offer special service in cities such as San Francisco and Cleveland.

Maritime Transportation

Open, including NY harbor, which is doing individual vessels inspections and escorts into the harbor

C.	Political Updates

Indications are beginning to point to a substantial military strike against Bin Laden assets in Afghanistan as well as the Taleban government.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's chief economic adviser:  "We've been working on getting the basic infrastructure of America up and running again, that's the main thing we've been doing."
World Bank officials want to cancel their annual meeting in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund, now slated for Sept. 28-29 in Washington, according to media reports.  The DC police have also asked that the meetings be cancelled, but World Bank officials must wait for Treasury Secretary O'Neill to make the decision. Bank officials fear the Bush administration will want the meeting to take place to underscore that Washington is back to business as usual.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.


There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond.

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Hello, glad to hear you are well.  This all depends on who owns the domain name.  If it is Enron Europe we need to forward all inquiries to Price Waterhouse - this is important as Enron Europe is no longer part of Enron and the administrator has all legal claim to the name.  I have no idea what happened to the sale of EnronDirect and who now owns it.  I would suggest ringing London and asking to talk to someone from Price Waterhouse managing Enron Direct.

The DC Circuit Court of Appeals has extended the date for states and sources
to comply with the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulation to May 2004, from the
original May 2003 date.

Background

Back in May 1999, a federal Court stayed the NOx SIP submittal deadline for
States, pending the final outcome of the NOx SIP litigation.   After the DC
Circuit Court decided the case in March 2000, EPA asked the court to lift the
stay on the NOx SIP submittal for States and give the states the same amount
of time they would have had to submit their SIPs, had the stay not been
imposed in the first place.   Industry sources opposed lifting the stay, and
also asked the court to move the complaince deadline back a year, due to the
delays caused by the litigation.

The Court lifted the stay on June 22, 2000, but was silent on the issue of
the compliance deadline.  States are now required to develop their "State
Implementation Plans" (SIPs) by October 31, 2000.

Yesterday, the Court decided that sources should have until May 2004 to
comply, giving sources an extra year to prepare for the new regulatory regime.

Remaining Questions

With the previous 2003 compliance deadline, the NOx SIP Call regulations were
on the same time schedule as the Section 126 petitions, which were approved
by EPA (though a separate regulatory process -- a nearly-identical fallback
to the NOx SIP call) for many of the same sources and states as the NOx SIP
Call.   The Section 126 Rule is going to be litigated starting this coming
November, but the Court has not yet issued a stay of those regulation, nor
has it delayed the compliance deadline to 2003.   Unless the Court places a
stay on the 126 Rule and delays the compliance deadline to 2004, sources
could still be required to make substantial NOx reductions starting in May
2003.   We expect the Courts to resolve this issue sometime before the 126
litigation commences in early November.

Enron Activities

SIPs are being developed by the states, with a deadline of October 31, so
Environmental Strategies will be spending the next few months working to
ensure that the rules that are crafted in the states provide the most
favorable treatment possible for our assets while providing a competitive
advantage to our traders.   While the delay could benefit some Enron assets
that need to comply with the regulations, it could also benefit our
competitors, who have another year to defer environmental compliance
decisions that would likely increase their costs and create other
disadvantages for them.

We will keep you posted with any developments as they occur.

Guys, the outside date on termination due to force majeure was moved to
October 31,2002.  It is our risk to construct the pipeline;however, it is a
breach of contract if Petrobras does not have gas at the site by April 30,
2002.

We will need to add/assign this cost to NNG and TW Marketing cost centers under Dave Neubauer (probably Kim's??).  It needs to be included in the Gross O&M and in Project Specific Capital if it is not already (no effect on net O&M).  Then we will assign the amortization expense to the same cost center when we complete the functional earnings statements for Dan's Commercial Group.

Jeff:

I'm sure this is just a "misunderstanding", but I know that UBS Capital has spent innumerable hours with management.  While Mark says that he doesn't want LJM to have an advantage, it looks like LJM is being put at a disadvantage.  You would think that Cliff and Mark would welcome a new bidder with open arms after failing to sell this business for 2+ years.  Until this is resolved, I'll assume that LJM is out of the bidding and will not do any further work.  Enron is back to one bidder (the lower one) -- better for our company ???

Colleagues:
I hope that a short note on methodology on accomplishments' valuation will be
of help to all of us at this stage.  Up to this moment, the current criteria
is still the same established by Jim, John, and Gia Team in the last two
years.  Its purpose was, and still, is to ensure that Public Affairs
continues to generate more value than actual expense.    The process,
hopefully, should drive GA staff to view themselves as "originators" creating
bottom-line value through (as an example):
revenue enhancement (new opportunity, market expansion)
cost reduction (e.g., fee delay, rate decrease).

The value calculation process focused on the following rules (called SCORE):
Simplicity
Consistency
Objectivity
Reasonableness
Equity

Perhaps it is helpful  to list some of the methodologies submitted so far.
With no specific preference, they are:
A percentage of Enron's business on a specific hub, or transmission
connection (the percentage is subjectively determined)
Impact of a specific deal on Enron's stock price (in total or part, again,
subjectively determined)
The result of what-if analysis to estimate the would be cost had the
legislation passed (or did not pass), or a settlement reached (or not reached)
The amount of financing needs that was secured for a deal
NPV of a project.  An extension would be the size of market identified or
deals originated.
The market size that Enron is targeting.
Value at risk in a specific project or activity
The methodology adopted by the relevant regulatory regimen to calculated
specific cost item that have been deferred, reduced, or avoided.  An
extension would be the impact of tariffs determination after intervention (in
part or total).
The buy/sell spread of a portion of the market size that was released after
intervention.

I shall keep you posted with any change--in any case, it  shall not happen
without full consultation with you--meanwhile, please let me know if you have
any question in this regard.

Dear Enron Employees:

I'm sorry to report that a third Enron employee has died in the hospital as a result of injuries from yesterday's explosion and fire at Teesside Power Station.  To lose another employee is a devastating blow to all of us.  A fourth employee remains in the hospital and is in stable condition.  Please keep these employees and their families in your thoughts and prayers.  We will release their names as soon as all family members and relatives have been notified.

I'm in the U.K. now and will be visiting with the employees and families who've been affected by this tragic accident.  I will also visit the site and will meet with authorities in order to determine the cause of the explosion.  I will keep you posted on any new developments.

In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

Mark Breese	EB-1457a
Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.

Origination and mid-market should work together to prepare 1 combined list.
Producer origination and producer mid-market should work together to prepare
1 combined list.
By next Monday (Feb 12) I would like to have the combined market list and
combined producer list identifying target customers and ENA responsibility.
By Monday (Feb 19) I would like to include Credit, EOL Registered, EOL
participation level, and existing business.  Select someone in the group to

Today, the House Ways and Means passed it version of the economic package.  The package included a repeal of the corporate AMT retroactive until 2000 and refundable AMT credits.  The stimulus package is expected to be on the House floor later next week.  This is a positive development because it puts us in the very best negotiating position as the focus moves to the Senate where there is less unanimity on repealing the corporate AMT.  Please see the memo below for more info.
Also, the House Ways and Means Committee passed a 2-year extension of the Wind Production Tax Credit.

Attached is an analysis of the probability of a devaluation in Argentina and
the contractual protections TGS has in the event of a devaluation.

Long and short of it is -

Argentina's economy is primarily dollarized and it would appear that a
devaluation would do considerable short term harm to the economy.

Convertibility Law was enacted in 1991.  Large part of the population
remembers the super inflation of 1989 and 1990.

To devalue the currency, Argentina would have to amend the Convertibility Law
- this requires  approval of the Federal Congress.

TGS has numerous layers of protection from a devaluation - in addition to the
Convertibility law, it has protection through its license and regulations.
Indeed, as you remembered, the tariff is indexed to the exchange rate.

A concern is - to the extent the Government takes action as drastic as
changing the Convertibility Law to implement a devaluation, and it is willing
to suffer the short term economic and political harm of a devaluation - then
there is a reasonable chance they would go the extra step and find a way
delink the tariffs of the privatized regulated companies from the dollar.
In this case Enron would have protection under the BIT treaty.

The impact on Enron's P&L is a function of whether or not we use the Peso as
the functional currency.  If we use the Peso as the functional currency -
Enron would have a signficant negative translation adjustment from a
devaluation.  If we use the dollar as the functional currency - there would
be no impact on our income statement.   I will research this further in order
to ensure we can use the dollar as a our functional currency.

Sherri,
Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to
have
Jeff Skilling as a keynote speaker.
Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that Jeff speaks at this conference I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about this conference and  I think that this will be
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.
I shall send a separate message to Jeff about this request.

That is correct.  The buyout value from the desk as of 10/26/01 was $810,000.  This was determined by PV'ing the value of the remaining monthly demand charges owed to ENA from November 2001 through the end of the GSA (6/30/08).  The nominal value of each monthly demand charge is approximately $11,500.

Good Morning!
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month.
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow.
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:
Sun 	11/18 	47 Bcfd
Mon 	11/19 	54 Bcfd
Tue 	11/20 	67 Bcfd

As you are aware I forwarded and offer to VNG that  included 4 transactions whereby ENA would sell quantites to Sequent. In addition, I requested that Sequent provide ENA with an offer to serve the Hopwell transaction ( did not tell VNG that it was Hopewell, just described the general service).  Dana Grams told me last week that they were concerned about entering into an agreement to get back their assets, because they felt we may file bancruptcy at which point they would get the assets back for "free".  This is a lame excuse and I generally told him so.  I told him that we were not going to give back the assets and if he wanted them back we needed to get the same or better value to terminate our deal early.  He said they would revisit the arrangement and let me know.  I will keep you posted.

consumers in several states are able to choose their energy provider in much

On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.  The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.

1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.

2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.

Aitor Moso of Iberdrola told me in Madrid yesterday that Iberdrola have
"inherited", at least for a few months, 550 MW of import capacity under use
it or lose it rules introduced by RTE in '99 or '00. Apparently EdF had kept
using that capacity till early Winter, then kept nominating it for use, but
actually did not use it for four months. The reason was excess hydropower
availability in Spain driving prices down. Once the four month period
expired, EdF lost the capacity rights and Iberdrola jumped in and booked it.
I assume Raphael and Paul are aware of all this.

I was also told that RTE is holding a seminar on their France-Spain
interconnection capacity auction proposals in Paris next Monday. Iberdrola,
Endesa and Hidrocantabrico (not surprisingly!) seem to be supportive. Are we
attending?

All these developments will of course be relevant to our answers to the Phase
2 questionnaire. When it arrives (tomorrow or Monday?) we may only be given a
few days to answer it. Are we prepared?  Bruno and Nailia have some days off
in the next week or so let's get to work in advance - providing Ross,
Mariano, Paul and Gregor back an intervention. The three previous submissions
to DG COMP to work off are:
a) '99  (?) on France/ Spain exports,
b) '00 on EdF/ EnBW, and
c) '01 on EdP/ Hidrocantabrico.

I foresee the most obvious remedies to target being:
1) Freeing up LTRs on interconnectors.
2) Enhancing VPP auctions.

COP-7 --- Update on Progress

The mood at the climate change negotiations has picked up considerably since my last email. A compromise has been reached on the Kyoto Protocol compliance regime, which has given delegates hope that Ministers can forge agreement on remaining contentious issues by the end of the week.

Under the compliance deal, the Kyoto Protocol will retain its legal status, but decisions on binding consequences will be adopted post-ratification.

The rules for the market-based mechanisms and national reporting still have significant unresolved issues, which are being negotiated as I write this report.

In the meantime, Ministers arrived last night and have been making their opening statements all day. This will continue for some time.

U.S. Under Secretary for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky arrived yesterday evening, but has not yet briefed the U.S. business community. She has scheduled a briefing for tomorrow evening. Traditionally, the U.S. delegation meets with business observers almost every night - the delegation has not met with U.S. business community since last Friday. Many are frustrated by this.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Otherwise, I report more tomorrow.

--- On a separate note, my thoughts are with every one during this trying time for Enron - there is not much more I can say, but I am reading all the clips and, like you, trying to stay focused and hoping for the best.

Again, if you would like to contact me please try via email or call me at +41793453046.

All the best,

Everyone,
I am beginning to receive phone calls and emails from some of the CA
businesses that Ken sent letters to on Monday.  I will be tracking these
businesses through a database, but we need to start following up with phone
calls and additional information.
I will keep you posted on who is asking for more information, and all
materials that we send to these businesses going foward.  However, I will
need your help in placing follow up phone calls.
To that end, I would like Mark and Rick to make the first two phone calls
today.  Keep in mind we sent out two letters.  Before you contact these
folks, you might want to check the list to see which letter we sent out.
(I'm attaching the final list.  The highlighted companies - 15 -  received
the letter from Ken that indicated he would follow up personally.  Everyone
else - 100 -  received the generic letter).
****Whomever you talk with, be sure and confirm the address and phone number
and names for where we should send future information (see list) thanks!!!

A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.
Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.
Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.
Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.
Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.
Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.
Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.
Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:
I.	During regular business hours
A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.
-OR-
B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.
II.	After hours
For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

Guys, I want to clear up a couple of points:
a) if you had received a retention payment in early December with a date that expires Feb 28 - that retention payment will not be at risk in any way if you do not work for NETCO or if you choose to join the effort towards NewCo. That payment was made on behalf of the Enron estate to ensure critical operations  are completed and  key people are retained;
b) we are working to provide, as per our discussion this am, a new retention package for estate (and NewCo) employees for the next 90 days that should be forthcoming in the next several weeks;
c) you are not in breach of your employement agreement by working towards NewCo versus Netco or the overall estate regardless of which company wrote or sponsored your original contract (ie) ENA , EES, EGM, etc.  These are all Enron assets; and
d) I envision that NewCo upon it formation will have its own compensation plan which will provide competitive base salaries, a bonus program consistent or better than Enron's or possibly similar to what is being discussed about Netco, an equity participation plan, employment agreements and a competitive benefits package.

By copy to Jeff McMahon, I wanted everyone to know this is consistent with the overall message that I have been receiving.

Gregg/Richard, great work on getting Peoples to work with us.  I will look for a copy of their letter requesting assurance that you mentioned.  Please let me know what PGL decides about buying the NSS inventory (13.5 Bcf).
Until we hear from them, please do the following:
(1) Identify alternative Jan/Feb NSS markets for as much as you can withdraw.  Hopefully PGLC will buy the inventory as planned, but if they do not we need to have alternatives worked out.
(2) Detail your plans for liquidating the inventory in the PGL Hub (3.78 Bcf - enovate 1.08 Bcf and EMW 2.7 Bcf).  As part of that, please provide details on the total already committed to (a) physical baseload sales, (b) physical option sales and (c) remaining inventory.  Regardless of the hedges that were in place, we need to get any uncommitted gas out of the ground and sold (preferably pre-pay) as soon as possible.
(3) Forward copies of the documents which evidence our rights and obligations under the three storage agreements (EMW/NSS, EMW/ PGL Hub and enovate/PGL Hub).  If no documents exist, please forward any documentation (correspondence, emails, copies of invoices, etc.) which would evidence Enron's to the to the inventory.  Please fax any such documentation to me at 713-646-3460.

Over the past several weeks, we have seen an increase in the number of
"killed" or modified EOL transactions.   Please remind each of your
respective groups that this is not an option. Once a customer "clicks" on a
deal, we have a valid, binding contract.   We lose our audit trail, and we
can potentially expose ourselves from a Legal standpoint.   I talked to Mark
Taylor about this today, and the best option is for Legal to prepare a
termination agreement when we agree to let a customer out of a deal.  We
(Product Control) should be notified immediately if someone is requesting to
change an EOL deal.  You can call either myself, Jennifer Denny (x35824),

Congress Passes the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000
Late Friday afternoon, December 15, Congress passed the Commodity Futures
Modernization Act of 2000.  The purpose of the Act is to eliminate
unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities
falling within the  coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act ("CEA") and the
provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives
transactions.  By enacting such changes, Congress intends to promote product
innovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets.
Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron's further product
innovation and growth.  Specifically, the Act provides important legal
certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an
over-the-counter (OTC) bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic trading
platforms.  Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation.
Bilateral Transactions
Under the Act, bilateral transactions in all commodities (other than
agriculture commodities) that do not occur on trading facility (i.e. not on a
multi-party exchange) are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long as
the transactions are entered solely between "eligible contract
participants"(i.e. persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital
thresholds and other requirements under the Act).  This provision essentially
codifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forward
contracts, thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has
frustrated product innovation and growth.
Multilateral Transactions
In addition, the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement, contract or
transaction in commodities (other than agriculture commodities) so long as
they the transactions are between "eligible commercial participants", are
entered into on a "principle-to-principle basis" and that take place on a
multi-party "electronic facility".  This exemption could facilitate expansion
of EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legal
requirements will have to be met.
Other Transactions
The Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are
of interest to Enron, including "credit risk measure" commodities and weather
derivatives .  Again, the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet
certain legal thresholds.
This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective
support of many Enron employees has been crucial.  Thank you to all that have
contributed to the passage on this important legislation.  We will have a
more through legal summary of this legislation in the near future. Do not
hesitate to contact me at (202) 466- 9158 of Mark Taylor at (713) 853-7459
with any questions.

Thanks for hosting the breakfast and for emphasizing the importance of the
PRC process to the success of Enron.  Prior to joining Enron, I worked at two
other companies in the mid-stream natural gas industry.  As I was listening
to you speak about the way Enron was in the pre-PRC days (the Hay system and
the like), memories of some of my experiences in those organizations came
rushing back.  Although I had a number of important reasons for leaving those
companies, the key issue in both instances was the failure of their
performance review processes.

I share that information because I have seen both sides, the worst and now
the best.    As with most things, those who complain or criticize often do
not really understand or appreciate how good they have it.  Criticism is
often fostered by a lack of understanding - - people asking "why?" in a
destructive way.  The information you shared about the importance of the
program to Enron,s continued success and the points you made in response to
some of the criticisms of the process were both very important.  I will take
your message and pass it along, however, I respectfully encourage you to do
likewise to all of Enron.  I know you have previously stressed the importance
of the process at numerous times and through a variety of modes of
communication, but this morning you really gave the all-important reasons WHY.

I appreciate being selected to be on the committee and look forward to
participating.  Thanks also your leadership, it's truly inspiring.

Please find attached the code for the HJM simulation model for option pricing and other necessities.
The model takes as inputs prices and volatilities and generates a daily spot price grid and respective transition probabilities - a framework for pricing options of multiple kinds.
As it is, the model seems quite flexible and detailed. It takes care of fwd-fwd volatilities and uses different factor loadings for each month - this means that the model takes different PCAs as as the curve shrinks in time. Also, the user may define as many factors as the size of # of points in the fwd curve.
One interesting aspect is the way I evolved the spot price to provide convergence to the prompt month price as the month approaches its end. Before shocking prices (spot and fwds) I get the expected spot for the next day by linear interpolation with the prompt fwd. By ensuring convergence, however, the model creates a spot price vol that converges to the prompt month vol. The phenomena is illustrated in the spreadsheet example where I call the model for each day of the first month to calculate the respective daily expected prices and vols.
As usual, I put the whole project on o:\research\common\project\options\HJM. It is self-contained - no need for other files and the whole source code is there. To see the the spreadsheet you need to install the fwd-fwd vol function and the loading factor function. You will find these things on o:\research\custom. Note that this is not necessary to run the model itself. It just makes the spreadsheet more illustrative and the code more understandable.
Regarding the last, I tried as much as possible to make the code clear and lean hoping that you feel confortable with its pieces and usability.
These are the files:

Jason (et al):

We are approaching somewhat of a slow-down in active harvesting development, and therefore it is a prime opportunity to begin hashing out what is required to gather the West Power load data you have previously mentioned.  We should get together personally to better organize this initiative, but some things to "prime the pump" are:

1)  What are the requisite sites involved?  (URLs, etc)
2)  What is the frequency of "jobs"?  (how often do we scrape the data; once a day, x number of time a day, etc).
3)  What is the nature of the data we are scraping?  (this will help us to determine if we already have a database schema that this will fit into, or if we need to extend/develop one)

These are just some topics to get us started...you may have already answered some/all of these previously, but I feel they deserve mentioning again, if for no other reason than to make sure we are all on the same page moving forward.

Please reply with your availability over the next few days (as well as anyone else you feel should be involved in this effort), and I will have Amanda schedule a meeting/room for us to get this started.

The last scheduled department meeting for the Government Affairs-The Americas
group, for the YEAR 2000, will be Friday, December 8, 2000 in Houston, TX at
the Doubletreee Hotel.  I have reserved a block of rooms for everyone
checking in the 7th and departing the 8th.   I also want to inform you that
the Enron Corp. Holiday Party will be held on Saturday, December 9 here in
Houston which will give those of you travelling in the opportunity to attend,
if you wish.

Questions you might have regarding the party.

1.  Are spouses invited? (? for employees outside of Houston)  Yes, but at
the employee's expense (ie:airfare).

2. Will Enron pay for the extra 2 nights at the hotel?  Yes, if you can
demonstrate that, even with the additional 2 nights stay, plus your airfare,
it will still be cheaper than a flight leaving the evening of the 8th.   A
lot of times airfare will be much cheaper with a weekend stayover.

Example: (a)  Round trip airfare (returning 12/8/00)  = $800.00 (airfare only)

Example: (b) Two additional nights at  hotel =     $500.00 (airfare w/a
weekend stay)
$218.00 (hotel 2/additional nights)
Total = $718.00

3. Will Enron pay for additional meals for the weekend?  No.  Meals will be
on your own.

If you are interested in staying the weekend, please let me know.  There are
individuals that need to be contacted with this information.

Please mark your calendars and call me if you have any questions.

I must apologize regarding the lateness of this e-mail. I sent the Excel file
with crude oil data as an e-mail attachment earlier this afternoon, and when
I checked my mail just now, I discovered that it had been rejected because of
its size.

I have reduced the amount of data somewhat by using the following
limitations: WTI Crude Oil swap transactions only, starting from January 1,
2001, with delivery in the USA. This allowed me to get rid of some
unnecessary fields. Please note that there are no calendar spread options or
basis options included in the data, and, as this is from Clayton's database,
it does not include failed trades or limit-order trades.

The Excel file ("Crude Data") can be found in:

I have started looking at the data already, but it does not seem possible to
plot all 24000+ points in one Excel chart. I hope this helps.

Lynn & Raetta,  In a conference call with Frank Semin, Courtney Barker, Gary Anderson and Ellis Stern today it was discussed on how the end of the month volumes have been estimated in the past dealing with 16 and 31 days charts.  Also, it was discussed on how this affects DDVC and other penalties that are billed from a Gas Logistics perspective.  Frank is needing to respond to MidAmerican on how NNG actualizes daily volume at their untelemetered (chart/index) end user points.  Frank would like to schedule a meeting with Gas Logistics, Marketing (Dave Neubauer), GMS (Gary Anderson, Ellis Stern) to discuss the end user agreements and the procedures that GMS uses when determining actual flow at the end user points.  Frank wants all parties within ETS to be aware of some to the issue involved in this process.

Lynn & Raetta,  could you schedule some time to discuss.  I would like to bring you up to speed on the previous conversations and calls that I have had with Marketing, MidAmerican and GMS on this subject.

As they say, "All good things must come to an end."

Unfortunately, this is hardly ever more true than in the IT consulting realm.  I have been informed that as of this Friday (11/30/2001), my assignment here at Enron comes to an end.  Obviously, Enron's current economic uncertainty predicated the need to alleviate any and all "excess baggage" (read: consultant/contractor costs).

I truly have enjoyed my time here in the Gas Fundamentals group.  I have definitely learned a great deal from everyone, and hopefully have helped others to do the same.  I leave my contact information below, in hopes that if there is anything I can do for you in the future, you will not hesitate to get in touch with me (especially to let me know what time to be at Front Porch! ;-).

All kidding aside, this has been a great overall experience for me.  From now until Friday, I will be involved in handing off all projects/initiatives that I have been a part of (or directly responsible for).  If there is anything needed of me (between now and then), feel free to give me a call (x5-8885) or stop by (ECS 06836) prior to Friday.

Thanks for everything, and I wish everyone the best of luck in their future endeavors.

Chris,

Here is our explanation of the 5 Day loss violation.  Let me know if you need
any more information.

Due to a forecast for mild November weather, futures prices have fallen
sharply over the last five days.   Nymex futures prices have fallen a total
of $0.68 over the last five days.  The Gas desk's loss is primarily driven by
a long price position held by the Financial desk, which averaged 7, 295
contracts over the same period.

Vince,

I thought I would just send you a personal note to say that I hope you are well. Being part Brazilian, I feel responsible to make sure that you enjoy the great country you're visiting. It is a shame that you will be spending time in Sao Paulo and not Rio, which is a far more beautiful city - I know since I grew up in Sao Paulo. I hope that your experiences of the past few days will not put you off paying further visits to this land.

When I arrived at work on Monday morning, Shirley asked me if I could call the Brazilian Consulate in Argentina, and she explained the predicament you were facing. I tried and tried to get through but all the numbers at the consulate were continuously busy. Eventually, we agreed that it might be best if handled from the Brazilian side of Enron. I understand from her that you have finally been able to get to Sao Paulo, so I hope that the business you went to discuss has gone successfully.

I imagine that by now you may have been introduced to a good Brazilian churrasco, tasted some real coffee, and perhaps sampled some of the many tropical fruits that Brazil boasts of (speaking from a culinary perspective). If you haven't yet been to any of the Brazilian restaurants here in Houston, I would be happy to introduce you to them when you return. I wish I could recommend good places to visit in Sao Paulo, but it is not really a city for tourists. If you had more time, I could suggest some art museums, a visit to the municipal theatre, or some relaxation in one of Sao Paulo's parks; a trip down to the coast would also be worthwhile.

Well, I wish you a safe return journey and look forward to seeing you back safe and sound. You were greatly missed yesterday morning at our Bosses Day Breakfast.

Tom

Frank and Tom:

I believe the instructions below quoting EOL and Credit are incorrect.

If the credit status of a counterparty changes and they "click" to execute an
online GTC, then our Global system should reflect the current online GTC and
not the previous online GTC.

Right?

Please read the following information from Dr. Venessa Holland, the Enron corporate physician.  You have been identified as a person who has traveled to the Enron Washington, DC during this time period.  You can contact Dr. Holland directly at 713-799-2224 or via email at vah@flash.net <mailto:vah@flash.net>.  Dr. Holland will be in the Enron Houston office starting at 1:00 p.m. on Friday, November 2.

The CDC has recommended new updated guidelines for facilities receiving mail from the Brentwood facility since October 11.  Individuals in private facilities receiving incoming mail from the Brentwood facility are recommended to receive a 10 day course for prophylaxis with doxycycline.  This should include all permanent employees in the Enron Washington office and possibly other visiting Enron employees to the Washington office who have had possible contact with mail coming from the Brentwood facility.  The final recommendations regarding the completion of the full 60 day prophlyaxis will be based on further information from the CDC.  These are the current recommendations as of October 27 and are subject to change pending recommendations by the CDC.

The CDC has recommended doxycycline for use for prophlyaxis.  Presently, there is no indication that the anthrax is resistant to any antibiotics.  Doxycycline is just as effective as Ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.   Doxycycline is a tetracycline drug and should not be used in anyone who is allergic to tetracycline.  Women who are pregnant should check with their Ob-Gyn physician prior to taking tetracycline.

All ENRON EMPLOYEES are encouraged to take the flu shot this year.  Since it is difficult to distinguish the symptoms of anthrax from the flu, the CDC has recommended that everyone have a flu shot.  All Enron employees from the Washington D.C. office and those who have visited the Washington D.C. office since October 11, should see their personal physician, if they develop any symptoms such as mild fever, muscle aches, malaise, shortness of breath and headaches.  These can be symptoms of the flu.  However, they also can be symptoms of inhalation anthrax.  If any such symptoms should occur, the employees should see their personal physician right away.  The employee should inform the physician where they work and what their exposure could possibly be from mail coming from the Brentwood station.

If you recall there was a physical term supply transaction done at Thompsonville with EEX during the time you were trying to get the letter of intent with AEP done.  I thought that there were some unique financing issues that required Enron to retain the transaction.  It appears that is not the case and since this supply is at a split connect location with HPL it should probably go with the sale.  I just want to make sure that the swap is done correctly to keep Enron whole.  Any thoughts?

Sorry, I thought you already had that info.  Phase 1 is the day we turn on EOL (January 21st), Phase 2 is February.  This timing should be consistent with the other gas regions.  Basically financial products first and physical products second.  If there is any changes between products in phase 1 and phase 2, how much lead time do you need?

This is about Enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for trading future of a movie's gross box office receipt. Rich sent to many people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide some feedback.

I think the idea (see below) might be applicable to other parts of Enron. We can call it "Dynamic bid-ask price process".
In fact, we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is submitted to the system within a specified amount of time. The final (clearing) bid and ask prices are just the last "tentative" price shown to the public before the bidding period ends. (So the customers can see the final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish.)

I think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via EnronOnline.com.

Jim/Wade,

As you are aware, I have been working with Vince's group on the Henwood model
data.  The target was to have data on all India plants collected by Jan. 15th.

We all know that getting power out o Maharashtra holds the key to being able
to solve the Dabhol challenge.  With all of your help, this model can become
the tool that tells us exactly how that can be done, and at what prices.

We are a substantial part of the way there on data collection, and have got
data of some 1500 plants across the country.  The spreadsheet for the same is
attached.  This will help you answer any questions that come up in calls
about the various plants.  Please note that we are located in the Western
Region, or WR in the spreadsheet.  We will be further scrubbing the data and
getting more recent and accurate information, especially on Maharashtra over
the next 2-3 days.

The Henwood team will be in India on Sunday, and will compare notes with the
team here.  I am arranging for a presentation on the model and what it will
do.

Wade - It would be good if a broad section of the team attend, including
Neil, yourself and Mohan.  I will talk to you about a convenient time for you
in this regard.

Neil & Mohan - Over the next week (Monday and Tuesday) I will need some time
from Vivek, Anshuman, Ravi, and a few others, to interact with the Henwood
team.  I will be abliged if you can make that possible.

The first phase of model runs (which will be done by Jan. end) will just give
us some more basic information, but I will need all of your inputs in order
to ask the right questions.  The idea is that as we go along, this model will
be used to answer all types of management questions concerning Dabhol, and
power evacuation out of Maharashtra.

This will be critical for the team going forward.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Howdy Golfers,

Tee times have been arranged on the East Course (18 holes of golf) at the Broadmoor for Thursday, November 8 (tee times: 1:40pm & 1:48pm).  The price for playing this course is actually $90; slightly cheaper than what is indicated below.  I have arranged for each of your golf charges to be charged to your individual rooms.  Please refer to the list below for additional charges such as, clubs & shoe charges.   I'm hoping to finalize all the activity choices by the end of the week, so please confirm by COB tomorrow Thursday, October 18 that your activity choice will remain golf.

Thanks!

Folks,

I have been a bit quiet here since reaching India, primarily because of the
delay in the arrival of the Henwood team from Australia.

They are finally arriving on Sunday, and Krishna is joining me in Mumbai on
Sunday evening itself.

I would like to fix a schedule to have a conference call with you on the data
and the type fo questions that you all would like to ask.

Stinson - Could you please tell me what time would be a good one for you all
to hae a confernce call, but not earlier than Monday evening, India time
(Monday morning Houston time).  Please jot me a note on what would be a good
time for the call.

I will work out an agenda for the call.  Primarily, it will be discussion of
the data and on what runs we should do to begin with.

Another key part of this will be the Rate Case that MSEB is filing, because
this will determine what wil be MSEB's paymet capability in 2001/02.  This is
critical for us.  We have our in-house expert who has been working on this
for some time now, and he will also present some of the material on that call.

Regards,
Sandeep.

PS::  I am forwarding the basic data that Henwood has sent to the whole team
so that you have an opportunity to look at it, if you havent already got it.

This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues.

One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border.   If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer.

I need to ask a quick question.  I was trying to get Pam to get Hope to confirm Nov. 5th as my start date so that there wouldn't be any surprises.  Pam said that Hope gave her the OK to call Bill to discuss my transition date but he wasn't there so she had to leave him a message.  I'm not sure if that was yesterday or day before but they are speaking a little more openly about me leaving now and she mentioned that he hadn't returned her call.  I think they know that 3 weeks is a bit much so I think the call that she made to Bill is more less to make sure that he doesn't need me any earlier.  What do you think?  Give me a call please to let me know if there is anything else that I need to be doing at this time.

With regard to your first question, yes there are additional design
capacities to be considered. The Topock lateral, which consists of the three
Topock points listed, has a capacity of 400 MDth/d.  Additionally, the
mainline capacity going west, which serves ALL of our markets in Arizona as
well as California, is at 1090 MDth/d.
As for your second question, the data fields that were highlighted in red
were more for my reference since these required some manual review/correction
on my part.
If you need further information or explanation, please feel free to contact

Chris/Hunter,

I just wanted to make you aware of EGM's intent to possibly separate their website from the fundamentals structure.  The impact of this would be that EGM content would no longer be available within the Commodity Fundamentals website.  I personally do not feel that this is the best decision for the business ENA&EGM, it would limit the current vehicle in which content is delivered.  I also believe that considering the current state of Enron this is not the time to duplicate cost & effort because of ownership concerns.  I've voiced these concerns to Randal Frisbie and just wanted to make you aware of the possible loss of content.

Thanks,

It looks like your team will be getting involved in some form on the DPC

I am attaching a small memo that I have addressed to Wade on the DPC position
and possible workout.  This is still a draft and will likely get shared later
with others.  I would love to get your comments on the same.  At the same
time, this also will give you some idea of the problem, in conjunction with

About the INFORMS presentation, there were many people showing their interests, including Prof. Suvrajeet Sen from Arizona, Prof. Jussi Keppo from Michigan, and couple of students from U. of Pittsburgh, CMU, and U of Maryland.
Prof. Sen invited me to meet his group there, Prof. Keppo wants to join effort in writing a paper, and a CMU student offer to join work for his Ph.D. requirement. (See their e-mails below).

Those opportunities sound interesting. I think it will be good for the company too because we will have additional people working on the problems that will benefit us. If you have any research problems that you want me to work on please let me know then.

On the other hand, I will not give away our secret. I will consult with you first if I am not sure how secret it is.

Hello...since I was working to reload some cycle 13 data for Northwest today, it seemed like a good a time as any to take care of these few foreign key violations as well.  These 4 points are reported on the Northwest site, but do not appear in our PIPELINE_LOCATION table as of yet (hence the foreign key violation):
458 OWYHEE COMPRESSOR
611 NORTH DOUGLAS RECEIPT (2001)
608 NOVELTY HILL M/S
612 FOUNDATION CREEK PLANT (2001)
If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts, that would be great.  If not, we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past.

Joe was visiting with Crystal Hand and Sam Rhodes, Oxy Permian, the operator for Altura Gaines (POI #78023), this morning.

They again expressed interest in increasing their capability to flow more volume at the above by increasing the orifice plate at the meter station.  They also have included estimated costs in their upcoming budget to increase the capacity at the processing plant to accommodate increased production anticipated in the first to second quarter of 2002.  If this plate change occurred, Altura could theoretically flow up to 30,000 dths/d into NNG.  They are projecting 40,000 dths/d.

They are also talking with Mustang at the 26"Plains i/c since they could deliver volume back to Mustang which could then flow to NNG or EPNG -- this might relieve the volume in the Hobbs System where other producers could increase their volumes.  However, Mustang doesn't want to pay the transport.  We understand Aquila owns Mustang.

Sherry has visited with Matt Chance, Dynegy, along with Debra Tower, scheduler who monitors the volumes at Warren Eunice (POI #6751).  Matt has expressed concern regarding the frequent allocation of the Hobbs System -- severely affects Dynegy's equity volumes.

Joe and I are passing along this information for your consideration in addition to the GPM Linam Ranch point.

As he pointed out, it would be nice to have the first assignment for early next week. I agree with Vasant in terms of being almost impossible to get something ready by tomorrow.
Vasant also sugested that we use the Technical Corner Articles as a source for this. Maybe Sam may help on that. Whatever we do, however, we would like to have you review the final text.

I received notice today that Elsa Villareal , Gary Lamphier and Ed Gottlob have accepted jobs with AEP as part of the sale of HPL (not to leave until closing).    This means that my staffing needs after closing are as follows:

1 Lead Physical Trader
1 Physical Trader
1 Basis Trader (or at least an asst. trader)

1 Industrial/Utility Middle Marketer/Originator
1 Supply Middle Marketer/Originator

I met with Jeanie Slone and the internal recruiters today to start the external search process for an experienced physical trader and industrial marketer.
I am hoping the other positions can be filled internally with associates and/or internal commercial personnel.

I delivered employment contracts to Janet Wallis, Jim Schwieger, Stacy Neuweiller, Eric Bass and Daren Farmer.  They all wanted to review the documents and talk to me next week about it.  Janet did not give a good feeling that she would be willing to sign it.  I know that she has been contacted by companies other  than AEP about job opportunities and I know other Enron Units have talked to her as well.

Although we met Jim's numbers he is still hung up on the super vesting language for options; I'll keep working on him.

The others I did not get any read on, but I will talk to them next week.

Given the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the HPL transaction I want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and middle marketing desks to the Texas desk.

I will follow up with you when I return from vacation on Monday, March 19th.

It has been some time since we spoke at the San Antonio conference.
Unfortunately,as soon as I got to India I was diagnosed wih a slip disc and
had to be in bed for a long time.

In the mean time the team continued to work on the concept of a sale to
another state out of the Dabhol plant.  I have developed the concept whereby
we are now looking at a firm component (over peak period), and an infirm
power sale during the monsoon.

The series of quesions and comments from my team in te attachment below
should help you a bit to get a feel for the proposal.  I am currently in
Houston and reachable at 281-345-9870.  I maybe needing a surgery for the
slip disc but am currently on medication hoping that surgery won't be needed.

I would like to wis you all a very happy X'Mas and a Great New Year, and will
catch you in the NEw YEar in Houston to discuss this wit you further.  I can
see that soem structuring help will be needed on this, and would like to get

Just an update, to keep everyone current on the progress of this initiative:
We (Matt (from Unify), Liz, Dave, and myself) met today and attempted to find ways to directly relate the Passport information (from El Paso) to the corresponding prices etc. in Unify.  Unfortunately, we discovered that there is no direct "fool-proof" way to accomplish this.  However, we have come up with a couple of things to try:
Liz is going to contact El Paso directly, and see if there is any other information they can provide in the Passport file that better uniquely identifies each deal / cut.  Hopefully, this will be something that makes relating the data to Unify much easier.
Matt is going to take a look at the format / content of the "scheduled quantity" file that comes in currently through the EDI Hub.  It's possible that this file contains cut information itself, which would possibly alleviate the need to use the Passport file altogether.
I believe that succinctly recaps the results of our meeting today.  If I have misrepresented anything, please let me know.  Also, feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Bob,

I wanted to continue the analysis on mark-to-market that I had spoken to you
about on the phone.

I thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction
by
phone, so I am having Krishnarao who is in Vince's group explain the
transaction
to you.

Krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in India, and he has just
returned to Houston from India after working with the team here.

He will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction.  I would like
you to please spend some time with him, and then based on the discussion
please
send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market.

Please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the
Indian side.  This is a very important transaction for us, and we may need to
repeat this in coming months, hence setting up the system to account for these
maybe well worth it.  Also, what I am concerned about is that there will be an
Enron India (EIPL) account in India based on Indian GAAP, and upon
consolidation
there will be a US GAAP accounting in the US.  It is here that we would like
to
have mark-to-market accounting.  EIPL is structured through Mauritius, and
then
Caymen Islands.

Another key question to consider is that when we m-t-m the transaction in the
US
there will be a tax accruing in the year of m-t-m (say 2000).  However, in
India, as a result of the accrual accounting, there will not be any income
showing till the year 2002 or 2003.  We will need to know how that would get
treated, and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the
US.
I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied, since none of the
income is being brought back into the US (remains overseas - subpart-F and
other
concerns).

Finally, we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and
getting a fixed for floating swap in the US (this is still not allowed to
Indian
Corporates).  I need you to think about this too, and see if some type of
accounting will solve this issue.  Krishna knows what I am talking about, and
will brief you on the same.

Krishna - Please walk Bob through the three structures we had worked here.

Look forward to your help and comments.  This is going to be an exciting
project
for us all.

Regards,
Sandeep.

The reason we did not order them originally because we both thought they would go perfect with your new furniture.  She will need to get approval from you if you would like to order them.

In an effort to control costs for travel expenses, as Jeff Skilling suggested
in his floor meeting last week,  Rick would like for everyone to purchase
tickets from the Travel Agency in the Park (TAP), which is the preferred
travel agent for Enron.  The savings that Enron receives from using TAP is
insurmountable.  See below, a list of the contracts Enron has negotiated with
some of the airlines.  Whenever possible, plan to purchase tickets at least
3-7 days in advance.  Often the pre-purchase savings outweighs the potential
switching fee. The travel agency is also able to give you a better price for
hotel reservations through the Hickory rate, which is cheaper then the
corporate rate.  TAP's phone number is 713-650-8080 (web address:
http://www.travelpark.com)

I received a call from a Candice Karpakis with Williams Company and she wanted a list of our trading group.  She has done business with Enron for 15 years and has worked closely with Steve South on transportation on the Northwestern pipelines.  She would like the list so she knows who she should contact to do business.  I told her I would need to get approval before I could send anything.  What are your thoughts on this?
I did an expense report for you but it's only $314 so I thought I would wait and see if you had any additional expense I could add.
I packed your files and sent them to Don Miller.  I put a list of the files that were sent on your wall behind your monitor.
I will have my cell phone with me so please do not hesitate to call me.

Please find attached an Excel workbook listing different access groups for Research.  I have marked some users for keeping and deleting.  I'm not sure how you wish to proceed.  You can edit the list as you see fit.  Perhaps we can contact those who have particular groups (e.g. Weather) for updates on their list.

I am generally of the opinion that the lists should be as short as possible.  A directory that Lance and I share with the power group was deleted yesterday but nobody knows who did that.  I hope after this audit is done, we are much less at risk of something that like happening again.

I am losing my Logistics Manager/Transportation person, Daren Farmer to AEP.  I have talked to Chris Germany about this opportunity and he would like to do this job.  Does this create any problems for you?  Given the current uncertainty about NETCO headcount and considering any transition issues you may have with Chris leaving, I thought we should leave things the way they are for now but develop a transfer date to be in a week or two.  If you are OK with this move, I would like Chris to spend part of his time next week downloading from Daren as I have him through next Friday.

On another matter, I believe Daren has E-mailed you about an agency agreement that we have with Cleburne Plant that needs to be transitioned to the estate.  He knows the details as does Rick Hill (I believe he is in your group).  We should probably get someone else in your group plugged into this deal (Kathy Kelly?), to handle to the administration of this deal.  We should try to identify someone quickly so that he/she can download from Daren next week.

John,

A dangerous environment is brewing on the trading floor.  We have very large positions and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment, uncertain about future employment and now with new information about Lay's "golden parachute", I am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the Company (hero or zero attitude) or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade.  I hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the Company? (similar to what was done when we sold HPL).  The general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the "little" people that have been making the money for the Company are left out in the cold.  I also suggest that you move quickly to ensure appropriate compensation for key traders into next year.

I know the first move I suggested would have the effect of reducing morale further but this group has a lot of risk on for people that may not be 100% commited to Enron.  This may be too drastic action at this point but I think it should watched closely.

Msg. from Rick Shapiro

I know how eagerly everyone is awaiting the formation of the Resource
Allocation Working group*.  Below is a brief description of the group's
purpose and initial steps we will be taking.  I want to thank everyone in
advance for what I know will be a successful effort.

What this group is about:       Identifying best practices within Public
Affairs for prioritization of efforts and allocation of resources and
documenting the best practices for implementation as soon as possible
throughout Public Affairs.

How we're going to do it:  Quickly and efficiently.

Why we're doing this:  Because we have finite human and financial
resources.... because we have an obligation to direct those finite resources
to their highest and best use.

When we're going to start this process:  Initial meeting in Houston, January
7, 2000 from 8:00am - 11:00am (call in participation is perfectly acceptable).

What's required for initial meeting:  A one page or less description of how
your group prioritizes its efforts; how both human and financial resources
are allocated, and how all of this fits within your budgeting process (should
be distributed to all group members two (2) days prior to meeting).

Finally:  I am attaching material that my group has used over the last year
to implement a resource allocation/issue priortization process.  I will
provide a more detailed explanation at the initial meeting.  Please feel free
to call me if you have any questions before then.

*  You've either been nominated or selected, or volunteered for this working
group.  Congratulations.

Upon further reflection after the recent staff meeting, I have made the
determination that any and allengagements of outside resources, e.g., outside
counsel & consultants, public relations firms, etc... must be approved
through the Resource Commitment Review (RCR) process.  Accordingly, the $2500
trigger that had been in place is no longer.  To ensure that the process
works in a more timely manner, I am creating weekly RCR meetings (Harry, Jim
& myself) at which all pending RCR's will be acted on.  I will deal with
emergency RCR's as they may arise between the weekly meetings.

Bottom line, the RCR process is of enormous value to the group as it helps to
document that we are properly focusing the company's resources in the places
where it is of most value.  I firmly believe that whatever minor
inconveniences this change will entail, they are minor in relationship to
ensuring the success and credibility of the RCR process.

John:

Claudio put together a spreadsheet for cheking the change on a composed
jackup index against the change on individual categories of jackups and
semis. He did not weighted the index because we think we will benefit from a
simpler index price calculation by taking the straight average.

The results show a good R-square between the general index and individual
jackup categories - on the range of 0.7 - 0.8. Only one category displayed a
poor R-square - about 0.3. For semis of 4tht and 5th generation, however, we
noticed a degradation on the hedge effectiveness - R-squares about 0.2 - 0.3.
You may verify each regression by changing the choice cell (AX2 on Analysis).

Claudio is also starting to analyze how gas and crude past moving averages,
12 month swaps on gas / crude, and rigs utilization explains the daily rates.
We will forward the results as soon as we finish.

I have added a cycle '0' to all pipelines in the database...per our discussion, this cycle will be used only in an 'emergency' type situation (we didn't scrape any data (for whatever reason), and there is some available that can be manually entered).  By being '0', this also shouldn't affect the logic of Yan's reports, since he pulls the latest cycle available (read the largest number; if ANY scraped data gets in the DB, it will be returned in place of any cycle 0 data).

Any questions, feel free to ask...

Effective August 1, 2001, Enron Asset Management Resources will be acting as agent for the Citizens Communications Company at the Griffith interconnects on both Transwestern and El Paso.  I will be the primary scheduler in charge of communicating with the plant regarding its needs, confirming the gas at both interconnects, managing the OBA's, and allocating flows to the owners of the plant.

In order to ensure a smooth transition, I will probably be in close contact with each of you.  For the time being, we will use the burn estimates which come from the plant to determine our confirmed volumes on Transwestern and El Paso, as well as daily discussions we have with Duke, PPL, and our gas control.  In my absence, the rest of the Transwestern scheduling team will be trained to do the daily confirmations and work with gas control with regard to daily flows.

Thank you for all your cooperation.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

If you know you will be traveling, have a conflicting meeting scheduled or you are going to be on vacation, please notify me that you will not be attending the Thursday staff meeting.  Due to so many of you being on other floors, it is difficult for me to know your schedules.

I don't want to have to go back to box lunches, but it may be necessary if I cannot submit accurate numbers to the caterer.  When Vince consented to let us have more hot meals and use different caterers, it was on the condition that we watch the costs.  Please help me keep these expenses in check.

Vince/Stinson,

I met with Rebecca McDonald, and introduced her to Mr. Sud on Saturday.

The meeting went on quite well, and Mr. Sud repeated the point he had made to
me regarding NTPC buying the power.  He did not ask for any consulting or
other contract, but said that he would try to help.

Rebecca seemed happy with the meeting, but I do not know whether she has a
plan in mind going forward.

I can give you more details of the meeting if anyone is interested.  I do
believe that Mr. Sud is well connected in India.

Sandeep.

John,

I will need 1 senior analyst and possibly could fill some of my cash trading needs with an additional associate.  I have talked to Bryan Hull (third year analyst) about a one year rotation at our desk.  He spent his first rotation in the Texas Risk Group and did a great job.  His second rotation has been in the EOL Marketing Group.  He is interested in trading and is a sharp guy.  I would like to see some of the other folks coming in just to compare against him and to see if using an associate is a viable option for my cash trading needs.

Late last night, BKH requested ENA to guaranty the indemnification
obligations of TLS Investors, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ECT and the Member
Manager of Southwest Power LLC.  The guaranty will be capped at the adjusted
purchase price, presently expected to be in the range of $205 million to $220
million, and will remain in place for 18 months from the Closing Date.

RAC's view is that exposure under such a guaranty would not be materially
different from exposure under a direct indemnity provided by ENA if ENA were
the actual legal entity selling Southwest Power LLC.  RAC supports the
issuance of such guaranty to facilitate completion of the divestiture.

I am excited to report that we are moving forward in our HR commercialization
efforts.  As you may have read in the e-mail announcement April 3rd, the HR
community committed to Enron,s Board of Directors to commercialize at least
one of our innovative HR systems or processes.  Following is the vision for
our commercialization efforts:

Transforming HR,s value by bringing business fundamentals to the way we
operate and developing opportunities in human performance areas

Currently, we are looking at opportunities in three main areas to realize
this vision:

Managed services for our transactions
Packaging market ready systems/processes/applications
New market opportunities in Knowledge Management and Talent Management

Because this is such a critical factor in HR,s success, a team was assembled
to quickly analyze our commercialization opportunities and recommend go
forward actions.  This team will leverage information from HR leaders and
subject matter experts.  Everyone,s participation is vital to our success.
With full participation and support we will realize our board commitment and
truly transform HR to a business-minded entity.

You will begin receiving communication from the Commercialization team
immediately.  You will find the first request for action attached to this
e-mail. Please support the commercialization efforts with quick and
comprehensive responses.  I appreciate your cooperation and look forward to
realizing our commercialization opportunities together.

Vince,

Just to update you on how things are going with regard to EOL -

I had a meeting with John Arnold yesterday to show him what had been
accomplished to date, and I think that he was fairly impressed by the
information available. I asked him for his input, and he expressed his
interest in having a couple of reports made up that couldn't be created from
the format the data was in. I spoke to Clayton about this, and he has already
made changes that will reflect a number of the modifications John requested.

I am also continuing to research the issue of an automated trading platform
for EOL. I have some information about how the NASDAQ operates, and I have
looked at some websites for ECNs, such as Archipelago, Island and Instinet. I
have also had a look at the International Securities Exchange (ISE) web-site,
but they do not seem to explain much about their system. Any further
suggestions would be appreciated.

I want to find out more about where EOL is currently and what modifications
may be necessary in the existing system, finish reading the material at the
websites I have investigated, and then I will try to put together a

Enron is hosting a special event on Saturday, March 31st.  The first annual
Enron "Trash Bash" to clean up the banks of Buffalo Bayou between Shepherd
Drive and Sam Houston Park.

I am chairing the Check-In Team which consists of:
Registering all of the Volunteers
Handing out Enron T-Shirts and Caps
Passing out Gloves and Garbage Bags
Making Clean Up Section Assignments
For anyone who might be interested in helping me, please call me at ext.
30329.


Also, we need a lot of volunteers to walk along Buffalo Bayou and pick up
trash.  This would be a great family project, a good project for your childs
youth group or boy scout or girl scout troop.  It will also be fun.  They
will have live bands, lyou get an Enron T-shirt and Enron Baseball Cap, lunch
will be served at Sam Houston Park and there are a lot of good door prizes.
If you want to volunteer for the "Trash Bash" clean up, just show up at Sam
Houston Park on Saturday, March 31, 2001, at 8 AM to Register.  Clean up
starts at 9 AM and lunch will be served at 11:00 AM and after lunch door
prizes will be drawn and then you can go home feeling like you have done your
part for Houston's Waterway Environment.

I hope you will think about it and bring your friends, family, ect. and help
Enron clean up the Environment.

Challenge

Appetite for credit capacity is much greater than what is justifiable given credit quality of industry and liquidity of transactions.

General Themes

Dearth of liquidity in market (bearing in mind that EIM's purpose is to stimulate liquidity)
Poor credit quality
Highly structured nature of steel transactions (inventory management, illiquid options, etc.)
M-T-M Accounting and incentives related to achieving earnings targets
Size, tenor and rating drive credit exposure; size and tenor drive transaction value -- therefore ratings drive credit limits.
Producers are naturally long; end-users are naturally short; Enron is neither and explicitly takes credit/market risk on both sides of a transaction

Short-term Solutions

Consider expanding "risk pool" (with concentration limits) to provide more flexibility to commercial teams (Pitfall:  could be rapidly depleted to achieve short-term budget targets)
Reduce size of transactions and increase volume to achieve greater diversity and less concentration
Prioritize counter-parties to give consideration to those of greater strategic importance
Clarify/[expand?] purpose of E-DASH

Action Items

Plan more formal education for Steel Group centered around:
M-T-M Accounting
Basic Credit Analysis and drivers of credit exposure
Market Risk Analysis
Determination of Credit Lines
Calculating Credit Reserves
Link Budget Process to Credit and Market Risk capacity allocations
More clearly define view of liquidity with regard to different types of transactions/commodities
Explore risk syndication options
Compare credit evaluation results across business units to ensure conformity throughout Enron--study should take into consideration credit rating, size of company, size of transaction, tenor of transaction and collateral rights

I know, Zimin. It was/is an honest mistake, and I am hurting from it. It does seem that things have worked out, and that the issue has been resolved with Larry May and John Griffith. Additionally, I have been in touch with Jeremy Wong to ask that the ERMS coding be updated, and have been in communication with Eric Moon (Gas Structuring) to make sure that the structurers are aware of the changes made. Eric told me that they have always used the OSTRIP function for fixed price options in the manner which is correct by the documentation.
Paulo suggested that I find out if there are any power traders who use the function and alert them. I asked Alex but he didn't know of anyone. I also talked to Iris, but she didn't know of anyone either, although she did say that they have priced strips on the power desk before. Would you know of anyone who uses this function on the power desks, so that I might contact them? Thanks.

I have been working with the Henwood team that arrived today, and I think a

officicals from the transmission side and gather any additional data there
too.

Krishan got in last night (I conveyed your best wishes to him).  We will

Hope you and the team are doing well!!

Lynn, I have resolved Tony Gee and Matt Martindale questions concerning this weekend storage allocation for the gas day June 23.

Matt was concern that Tenaska's Mid-17 contract 106171 was cut by our storage allocation the first time on Intraday 2.  In fact this contract received a small cut on the Non-Grid AM cycle.  Matt changed his nomination in the evening cycle to change some of his supply from Northern Border's Ventura to Mid-17 storage.  This nomination change will now be code as "incremental" on his storage contract 21229 for the remaining cycles.  Tenaska was able to avoid storage allocation cut on their IDD contract 21229 until Intraday 2 due to a "PRR" code for supply cut by Northern Border at Ventura.  Our storage allocation  only cut Tenaska Mid-17 path for gas delivered to their contract 21344 due to storage cuts downstream.  I have advised Matt  to be aware of these problems when changes nomination.

Tony Gee thought he was being "bump" or cut in the Intraday 2 cycle on his IT contract 5915 and FDD  contract 102835 on his supply from Northern Border's Ventura.  Prior to Intraday 2 we donot true-up storage allocation cuts until Intraday 2 with Northern Border.  Tony was only checking his nomination with Northern Border on his contract 5915 and seeing all his volume schedule to flow.  Tony failed to check his schedule volumes in Hot-Tap after the evening cycle to see his actual schedule volume was cut due to storage allocation.   Advised Tony to check his schedule volume in Hot-Tap after each cycle.

John,

You or Greg need to address the various groups with whatever generic information you can as to where we are in the process, expected timeline, hurdles before start up again, starting VAR and general organizational structure.  People are moving from frustration to feeling insulted that they are expected to sit still with no information.  I know you have a lot on your plate but if we really want people to hang in there a little longer before we address each individual's situation they need some sense of when they can expect closure.

Stinson/Vince,

The Henwood runs for Dabhol are, at least temporarily, over.  However, the
main modeller for Henwood (David Yumigada) works out of their California
office.

It maybe worth our while to have him come and demonstrate the runs, and
explain the modelling algorithm to the larger group.

In aparticular, now that I am going through some of the comments people have
raised on the PSIM model, I think there is value in understanding the way
Henwood deals with Hot and Cold Starts, ramp up costs, and with issues of
cycling plants.

I think understanding these will help in developing the next version of the
PSIM, and will also give the group here ideas to build into existing models.
This is a suggestion, and so please let me know if you see value in this.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Dear all,

I completeley agree with Ben that Treasuries are the most liquid and reliable
benchmarks. I also think that FMAs have their own advantages and
disadvantages.

However, it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using LIBOR
as benchmark - at least to price anything related to Capital Markets (for
example, credit default swaps) . Our prices will always be different from
that on Capital Markets if we use benchmarks different from the Market.

As a half-way solution we can have different benchmarks - for example, use
anything, that we decide is closest to risk-free, to value products
significantly different from that priced on Capital markets,and LIBOR for
everything priced on Capital Markets .

We can adjust by manipulating other coefficients (event, liquidity,
recovery) for our purposes, but it looks like benchmark should be LIBOR.

To avoid negative default probabilites (for highly rated reference entities)
we can add cost fo repo and haircuts (as all bankers do).

Let us continue our discussion on this.

As the lead on both the tariff issues as well as mega status, please provide
me with the list of regulatory issues for discussion at this meeting.  Since
I am in Houston, I may want to personally discuss these with you in early
January.

Vrinda/Kelly,

Please do the same with respect to the PR issues.  Perhaps, early Jan maybe a
good time for me to get this list, so that I can discuss the same.

I will need the same to prepare the agenda and have the team prepare for the
meeting.

Ranabir/Rahul,

Mohan will be the lead on the finance side on the mega status, and my team is
already involving him in our discussions.  Would you like to have him prepare
a small list of finance issues ?

Sandeep (Katwala),

Please let me know of key things on the legal side for discussion.  You can
update the group on the CERC forming Act.  Please jot me a small note on the
legal  issues list when you get the message.

Also, I need to know who is likely to be on the ground from the regulatory

Vince/Stinson,

Please find below two attachemnts.  The Excell spreadsheet shows some
calculations on the savings from using Dabhol power as against a diesel
genset operating at a higher heat rate.  There is also a differential in
price of diesel, as against naphtha used by the plant.  I have taken data
from the Septemeber bill of DPC.  We do not want to give the actual numbers
to the press, since they ar likely to have a field day with the 6 cent/kWh
energy price of Dabhol that is reflected there.

The seond attachement (Word) has the wordings that I think we can send in to
the press.  Please review the calculations and the note, ad if you find this
satisfactory, please forward to Jeff/s.

I am availabel on mobile if you have questions o clarifications.  The number
(610 MW) for total captive generation in Maharashtra) is taken from Mohan

(Scheduled Receipts less Scheduled Deliveries less Fuel)  *  Avg index = imb value.    - - Currently, if TW owes a shipper for an imbalance (scheduled receipts are higher than scheduled deliveries and fuel) uncollected transport and fuel is not deducted from the amount payable to the shipper.

There have been few cash outs by TW to shippers in the past.  I can recall one instance when a large payable balance was created and the shipper nominated additional volumes to reduce the balance to a minimal amount.  TW then paid the shipper for the remaining balance.

Also,  oba statements which reflect payable balances at receipt points do not deduct unbilled transport from the amount due to the operator.

Does our tariff allow us to deduct transport and fuel from paybable imbalances -  Will we have to reimburse shippers/operators for overbilled fuel?

He lacks a background in finance, which may be a minus for a position in the

Louise,
Attached is a new table derived from the list we reviewed on Thursday.
This table, combined with the BoD approved Transaction Approval Process (TAP) on the RAC Website (rac.corp.enron.com), should provide originators in the Americas with a roadmap for seeking spending approval and indicate where authority and responsibility lies for such approval.  (FYI, the TAP is likely to change at the next board meeting--I'll send you a revised version next week.)
The next step is an initiative to improve spending controls by linking DASH approved levels to the Accounting and Treasury systems.  Rick Carson will be heading up this project and coordinating with Accounting and Treasury for support.
Please distribute this as you see fit within your team.  Let me know if any changes are required.

As you know, Enron,s United Way Executive Solicitation is well under way.
August 9th is the target date to achieve 100% participation and finalize the
commitment from our executives and is also the date for the kickoff of the
company wide drive.  We have a way to go to meet this objective.  As of
August 8th less than 25% of our executives have turned in their pledge.
Enron,s United Way goal for the year is $2.3 million (before the corporate
match). ENA,s share of this goal is $346,500.  While these are aggressive
goals, they are very doable, and if everyone contributes their fair share, we
can easily surpass these goals.

Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I,d like to have 100%
participation throughout the organization.  This is especially important
among our executives.  We define "participation" as an employee who has
completed their pledge on-line and made a contribution, no matter what the
level.

I am a proud member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society, which is a
contributor of $10,000 or more and have pledged significantly more this year
than last year.  Given the fact that Enron executives are highly compensated
with generous options and bonus program, I encourage each of you to become a
member of the "Make a Difference" Club, which is a contribution of 1.2% of
your annual salary.  I would also challenge each of you to increase your
pledge this year, regardless of your level of giving last year.

With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I,ll need the
support of you and your campaigners to increase participation levels across
the ENA organization and reach our financial goals.  Whatever your decision
regarding the level of your pledge, we need 100% participation from our
Executives in order to set a good example for the rest of ENA.  Your
contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our
community.  When you give, you change a life right here in our community.

Please join me in setting the standard for ENA by giving generously and
getting your pledges in by August 9th.

When the Power p&l was added to this book last week the formulas did not

First of all, don't ask me why I'm still up at this hour, 'cause even I don't know...but since I am, I guess I can be accomplishing something constructive, so here goes:

Questar appears to have returned to normal.  Their data is now up to date, and I have re-enabled all of the jobs.  Hopefully things are back to normal for them...

Overthrust appears to be back up, albeit at a slightly different URL ( they moved from:
<http://152.137.64.16/cgi-bin/r30cgi32.exe?piprodit>
to
<http://152.137.64.16/cgi-bin/rwcgi60.exe?piprodit> ).

A slight change, but enough to affect us (if ONE character changes in the URL, it affects us).  So, I have modified the capture jobs for Overthrust to use this new URL...hopefully they also have stabilized.

Now, there is still data that has been missed for these pipes...we should look into possible recovery at the earliest convenience.

Anyway, just wanted to give everyone a heads-up of the happenings...

Thanks,
Chris

First I want to thank you for all of your help in Kansas City, I think the training went very well.  If you have any suggestions for improvements I would really appreciate your feedback.  Secondly, If you had any comments or suggestions from the customers during the training I'm trying to get them together so I can include them with the feedback given at the other break sessions.  You can send them via e-mailing or come by my desk.

Also several of you mentioned given the new hires the training document, I think this is a great idea so I'm attaching a copy.  If after going over the document there are some questions, let me know and I will be glad to meet with them.

The completion of the identified scrapable East Desk pipes is in site (pun intended :-)...there are only a few outstanding issues remaining.  The pipes in question are:

-  National Fuel and Gas
This site does a bit of checking to verify how you get to them...basically, it appears they make sure you come to them from a source they trust.  Attempts to work around this have so far failed, so Tara has placed a call to them directly to try and get a resolution to this problem.

-  TCO
We have discovered a work-around for the strange Javascript issues of this site, but now have discovered that this alternative way to access the data does not necessarily report as much as the original.  Sabina is looking into this, contacting the pipeline themself for help.

-  CGT
This is a "sister" pipe of TCO, and thus has the same Javascript issues.  We have also found a way around this, but Eddie is not completely certain the data is the same.  I'm going to work with him this afternoon to see if together we can figure it out.  It may be that CGT has the same problem as TCO (not as much data reported in the alternate method).

And that's it!!  TETCO has been finished today, and Iroquois has been set up as a manual entry pipe.  So, from what we can see, finishing the above 3 pipes finishes off the everything identified thus far for the East Desk.

Now, my only question is ...who's bringing the keg in on Friday?!? ;-)

As always, any questions, just ask.

Thanks,
Chris

I left you a voicemail as well.  I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it appears the ESOP rollover into Savings Plan ocurred as we discussed last week.  I got into the Savings Plan on Friday 11/23 and moved the Enron shares to Stable Assets also as we discussed.  It appears that the price used was Monday's close of $4.01 instead of Friday's close of $4.71.
So where do we go from here?  I am assuming per our previous meeting that whether $4.01 or $4.71 is used; that one of these prices will be used to keep me whole versus a price sometime in September (probably September 30th) when the ESOP shares should have been put into the Savings Plan.
Please call me at you earliest convenience to resolve this.

There are increasing requests for IT development resources for databases and
websites within the group.  There are two issues involved regarding this
activity:  Enron Networks is now charging for such development, and the
production of these many and various projects leads to high maintenance needs
and projects are often abandoned after short use.

If you need a new database, it should be developed in one of the desktop
applications that everyone has - Word, Excel or Access. Such
documents/databases can be shared on the O: Common/Public Affairs drive.  If
your needs are more complex than these applications will support, or if your
needs are more global, an effort should be made to fit the data into the
Project Tracking database.  Contact Elizabeth Linnell for this global
database.

Products/information to be published to the intranet should be placed on the
existing Public Affairs intranet site. Having multiple sites is confusing to
our customers and an ineffective use of resources, as well as expensive to
develop and maintain.  Contact Earlene O'Connell regarding additions to the
website.

It appears that the wrong service was stopped last night...a request to stop/restart the real-time weather service also seems to have resulted in the stopping of the Jaguar harvester.  This caused no scrape jobs to run last night.

This morning the service has been restarted, and data has been recovered.  This should be examined closely, as there is the possibility that information is the same for cycles 1 and 2 of certain pipes (this may or may not be an issue...if it is, please advise us on what should be done).

Accounting Course 1 covers the accounting basics everyone uses, and covers the entire pipe.  This is the lowest level of difficulty.
Accounting Course 2 encompasses SAP, report retrieval, A/R reconciliation and imbalances, these skills are used on a daily basis.  This is a more intermediate level course.
Accounting Course 3 is more advanced accounting training, covering the accounting systems GVA and TAS, and the more complex reports for variances and pathing.  DDVC's and rolling priorities are more specific to the north end of the pipe.

Sorry my reaction was not as positive as you hoped but your comment about not being able to discuss who is on the team with anyone caught me off guard.  I don't believe I have any issues with financial terms that you said (again I want to see what it looks in writing).  I still don't fully understand your reasons for handling this the way that you are but at the end of the day you are correct when you say that even if 50% of the commercial people is all that we end up, this shop will still be better than any other on the street.  I guess get me this document to look at when ever you can.

Thanks,

I just came back from a meeting with Accounting (Ryan Siueck) and Credit (Rod
Nelson - works with Bill Bradford) in which we presented the two-factor model
for calculating credit loss on our LJM's position. Rod seemed positive with
the model conceptual approach. He will position Bill Bradford on that.
Accounting will have a meeting with AA to discuss the treatment on credit
reserves on this deal tomorrow 9:00 AM. They feel my participation is not
necessary.

At year-end the difference on both valuations - without and with credit risk
- indicates a credit loss of about 100 MM.

The document will follow shortly.

A stochastic programming application that optimally trades power and operates a portfolio of generators to satisfy load commitment contracts, with uncertainties in power prices, fuel prices, and loads. Under transmission constraints, we can trade some amount of power with the market at bid-ask market prices. In this model, we also take into account the minimum up time and minimum downtime constraints as well as the startup costs.

Work number:        4420-7337-8327
Mobile:             44-7730-803-030

He said that in about two weeks, Jane will be here in Houston to attend
several training classes.

Doug also asked me to pass along a message to you, and I said that I would.
He lost his job in the recent layoffs at Compaq, and he wants to know if
Enron could use his talents.  He has an MBA from Harvard.  In the first two
months that he worked for Compaq, he identified $10 million in savings to the
company, and before he left, identified another $70 million in savings.  His
home telephone number is 281-345-4903, and his e-mail address is

If this truly cleans out the closet then it is worth it.  The potential upside of the Entex Audit is more like $2 - $3 million but our ability to recover that much is questionable given the weak contract language for resolving non-performance.  In the past ENA and Entex resolved volume shortfalls under the term contract by extending the term.  Obviously we will not have that remedy.  Do not let AEP separate other issues away from this and try to pick us to death.

Just as a heads up...

The web site that serves data for Kinder Morgan, Transcolorado, NGPL, etc. is having issues as I write this.  The following message comes up when trying to receive point data:

An error occurred while executing the page. Please use the "Back" button on your browser to try again, or try again at a later time. If the problem persists, please contact ApplicationName Support (user@kne.com).
The error message is:
[INTERSOLV][ODBC SQL Server driver][SQL Server]ct_results(): user api layer: internal Client Library error: Read from the server has timed out.

Basically, this means their server currently has issues.  I just wanted to send this out as a heads up that we could potentially miss some cycle information for the morning reports.  Hopefully, the site will stabilize before then.

Seems like HPL/AEP needs to get a transportation agreement on Oasis.  As part of the June transition ENA will not be doing any bidweek business at points other than Waha, Katy Tailgate and Carthage.  Therefore even if we wanted to cover this deal (which we don't), we can't.  Let me know if there is a problem with them getting there own transportation agreement.

Dear Messer's Skilling and Lay,

I heard a song with the lyrics "how can I say thanks for all the things you've done for me", I'm pretty sure it's by Andre Crouch.  Let me thank you for the help and loving kindness you and ENRON has shown to me during the period after the devasting floods.  I've never worked for such a wonderful company before, the people here in every walk of life are so very friendly.  The scriptures speaks of drawing people toward you with loving kindness, and you certainly have here at ENRON.  The people that i've met here want to be here and that's a good sign.  One morning on the elevator a lady was singing on the way to her floor, i didn't recognize the tune right away, probably because it was early morning, the tune turned out to be "OKLAHOMA" so I joined her, she invited me to come and be a part of the ENRON CHOIR.  Just  the other day you Mr. Skilling passed my desk and asked had my group just moved to the 31st floor, i've only been here at ENRON since January '01 and wasn't aware that my group had moved from the 29th floor.  My Grandmother always used to tell me as a child, "you better keep a thought in mind, that someones watching you, and they want to be just like you, setting their examples by you, and they're never gonna miss a single thing you do.  And I live by that today.  Well I can be a little longwinded,  but remember:

If I can help somebody  as I pass along,
If I can cheer somebody with a word or song,
If I can can show somebody that he's traveling wrong,
Then my living shall not be in vain.

And you both have certainly obeyed that dictum.


God Bless You Both,

Karin,

I talked to Mike Roberts (the head of the whole weather team), and he is
saying that all expenses for Tony should be charged to Global Products Team.
This is agreed between Vince and Jeff Shankman.
Mike and Vince are negotiating with John to put Stephen (or somebody who will
replace him) to some other cost centres (via research).

It looks like Kevin Moore is happy if Stephen is charged to the same cost
centre as Tony.
Let us right now charge Tony and Stephen to the cost centre below .
Please, could we charge them separately - when John and Vince make their
decision, we should be able to re-charge.

many thanks,

Vince/Rakesh,

I attended the Operational Risk meeting today that went on for almost 3 hours.  Other attendees were:
Andrew Parson (IT and assurance)
Mark Walker (Investment Valuation)
John Sorrelis (from AA)
Shawn from asset valuation,
and Wanda Curry

It was a general brainstorming session on what constitutes operationl risk, and how we can try to measure it within the organization.  The initial step will be to come up with the key risk indicators.  An initial list will be worked out by Mark and Andrew for further discussions. There is also an AA model that will be discussed to come up with what should be done at Enron.

Currently we will be going with a qualitative approach based on the key indicators developed.  Over time we would go with the standardized approach.

Mark was very interested in discussing the model he has developed for quantifying operational risk.  A meeting to discuss that with the Research group will be held next week, and I will get an appropriate date for that.  Wanda very much wanted you to attend, Vince.

We can talk on Friday or early next week on what our participation should be.

It is my understanding that five AEP employees will in Enron's offices starting May 15th or 16th to get a better understanding of how to do the HPL trading and to direct the HPL bidweek activities for June (assuming close occurs for June).  To protect Enron's proprietary trading information for May and June I would like the AEP employees not to be allowed in the offices until after 10:30 AM for the duration of their stay.  From 7:30 - 10:30 AM is when the May business occurs and it is also when the communication occurs with HPL employees.

Another issue is what happens if we believe that close is going to occur June 1 and then late in bidweek it gets delayed until July;  who wears the risk positions?  My suggestion is that if AEP is going to set up HPL activities for June then they should wear the risk positions.  The way to accomplish this is to do the following:

1.  The initial core term index physical position plus all thirty day index deals will be swapped out at gas daily index at the nearest relevant gas daily index 	     point (ie. HSC or Waha) after considering any volumes to be targeted for storage injections.

2.  Volumes targeted for storage injections up to 400,000/d purchased on IFGMR HSC index related pricing will be sold to AEP in the ground at June index 	     + actual storage costs.  Volumes targeted for storage are those volumes that can phyically get to Bammel storage.

Examples

Case 1
Core term index position    100,000/d long  (50,000/d Waha, 50,000/d Texoma)
Thirty day index position    200,000/d long  (volumes at Thompsonville and Katy)
Total Index Position           300,000/d long

Vols. targeted for storage   200,000/d

Enron sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.  Any additional volumes would be sold to AEP at July index.  Enron sells 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR Waha and 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR HSC.

Case 2
Core term index position     200,000 short (50,000/d Waha, 150,000/d HSC)
Thirty day index position     400,000 long   (50,000/d Waha, 100,000/d Agua Dulce, 100,000/d Thompsonville, 150,000/d Katy)
Total Index Position            200,000 long

Vols. targeted for storage    200,000/d

Enron sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.

Executive Summary

US: Fed,s beige book reports cool results across the U.S.  Lack of
inflationary pressures gives Fed wider maneuverability to cut rates at end of
the month.  One Fed member says the economy is probably at or near the
bottom.  Leader of a U.S. manufacturing organization (N.A.M.) says dollar
overvalued as much as 30 percent.
Europe: ECB trims its forecasts for GDP growth and lifts its inflation
expectations. Euro continues to languish although it received a bounce
following anti-strong dollar comments by the U.S.  N.A.M.  Spain urged by the
OECD to open its power sector to competition.
UK: New minister for Europe dampens rumors of an expeditious adoption of
the euro in the U.K.
Country Update - Brazil: Three principal causes for the present energy
crisis: limited investment, limited private sector participation, and
regulatory limitations to bringing on new power plants.   Cardoso pledges to
adhere to existing economic policy platform despite the energy crisis.

Chris,

The Power Book shows a MTD origination variance of $17.5.  This is shown on
the origination file(Power Tab) and will be picked up on the NGP&L today.
However it is still not being added into the MTD tab because the book
administrator added the originator's name to the same cell as the origination
category.  It is just a concatenate problem, but I don't have access to that
file.  If you or Michael could fix that I would appreciate it.

We recently concluded an exercise to identify the top &ten8 objectives for
U.S./Canada Government Affairs for 2000, which I presented to the group at
the December 16 staff meeting.  Our success in achieving these objectives
will define the group,s success in the New Year.

Two of our top three objectives involve providing support to the Risk
Management group in EES.  Number 3 and Number 2 (one of the number 2,s) are,
respectively,

Ensure that PG&E,s generation-related stranded cost is &rolled off8 no
later than September 30, 2000 and generally protect and inform EES curves
Understand rules/tariffs/outcomes better than anyone else and convert to
information valuable to business units

As a general matter, it is imperative that we continue to assure ourselves
that our everyday efforts are focused on achieving the objectives that are so
critical to our success.  The way the group provides support to EES Risk
Management, and in turn achieves the objectives noted above, is one area
where there is potential to improve performance with a refocusing of efforts.

Toward this end, I am asking that these individuals take on the
responsibility, for their respective regional group, of being a point of
contact for EES Risk Management:

Mona Petrochko, Western Region  Kate Wagner, South Central/Southeast Region
Becky Merola, Great Lakes/Midwest Region Frank Rishe, Mid Atlantic/New
York/New England Region

Mona, Becky, Kate and Frank will work with individuals on the EES pricing
desk to improve the flow of information necessary for timely, accurate
utility rate curves and help EES develop strategies to improve the economics
of existing outsource deals.  I expect this activity will take a significant
portion of their time.  They will coordinate their efforts with Harry
Kingerski and Pat Keene who will continue to provide a centralized support to
EES Risk Management from Houston.

I recognize that many of you are called on from time to time to provide other
types of support to EES, for sales calls, licensing requirements,
environmental issues, legal support, and the like.  This change in no way
affects these other activities and you should continue to pursue those
efforts.

As a final note, I invite all of you to identify and bring to me ways we can
improve our chances of success in meeting any of our Year 2000 objectives.  I
am not interested in change just for its own sake but will certainly consider
doing things differently if our likelihood of success can be improved.

Best to you for the New Year!

Per your request, attached is an Excel spreadsheet with two tabs summarizing all capacity release transactions spanning the release period from 11/1/00 - 8/31/01.  The first one (as released) depicts the transactions by offer number as posted and awarded.  The second (breakdown by month) provides the information for each offer by month, the applicable rate charged based on index spreads and a recap of the value in excess of our max tariff rate.  I have also provided some footnotes on this report for your reference.  If you need the exact language in the special terms of each offer released by PG&E, I can extract the individual award summaries as I have done previously in a similar request for Lindy Donoho.

aggressive ideas.
Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group

This is an update on the O:Research folder.  We have had a case of sevral files getting deleted from the folder last evening.

The IT folks are currently restoring these from the backup they had from yesterday.  They will be replacing the files that were deleted but will not be overwriting those files that are still there.

This incident puts an air of urgency on the O:Research directory access project that I had written to the group about.  Bhala has been coming around to members in your groups over the last week to get a list of folders that you are responsible for, and the desired access rights to these folders.  This is information that only you can provide, and without this we cannot start limiting the access of people already having access to the folders.  (Incidently, I am currently rejecting all write access requests from outside the group till I have approval from one of you).

Please do treat this as an urgent undertaking in light of the incident yesterday.  We have already created a separate O:Research/External folder where we need to house all those folder/files where access is broader than the Research group.  Please help us expedite this process.  We would like to have this in place before the weekend.

Since the initial update on the transition of the metals business into Enron,
a tremendous amount of progress has been made by the London-based integration
team to achieve our goal of a seamless integration of the two businesses by
the end of the year.  We can now report that we are well on our way to
reaching this target and as a result of this work we will be welcoming the
arrival of the London-based metals team into Enron House over the weekend of
15th September.  Accordingly, I feel it is important to provide you with an
overview of one critical aspect of the transition process ) namely, the
re-branding and re-positioning of the metals business as a core commercial
unit within Enron.

We announced in July that the metals business would be re-branded globally as
Enron Metals.  This trading name will serve as the umbrella under which the
business will operate, with the exception of Henry Bath & Son Limited, the
metals warehousing division, which will retain its current brand image and be
recognised as an Enron company.  Since this announcement about our branding
strategy, Fiona Grant in Public Relations and Sue Kelly, our Company
Secretary, have started working on the re-branding programme.  A brief
overview of the steps taken to date and a summary of what should be expected
over the coming months is provided in the attached file.

As was stressed in the initial announcement about the change of name, a key
part of the integration of these operations into Enron will be the conclusion
of a successful re-branding programme.  To this end, given the size of Enron
Metals, the re-branding initiative will be phased in over the next few months
and should be completed by the end of 2000.  Accordingly, we would ask that
all staff bear with us through this process, as the new corporate identity is
rolled-out worldwide.

Any questions relating to branding issues should be directed to Fiona Grant,
Public Relations and Communications.

EOTT Energy Registers 2M Sub Units For Hldr Koch Pete

09/28/2001
Dow Jones Corporate Filings Alert
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- EOTT Energy Partners L.P. (EOT) registered 2
million of its subordinated units for its holder Koch Petroleum Group L.P.
for conversion into 900,000 common units in the company and an option to buy
another 1.1 million common units.

According to a filing Friday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the registration is part of a recapitalization agreement that the
company, Koch and Enron Corp. (ENE) signed Sept. 6, which still must be
approved by the company's unitholders.

Under the registration, Koch may sell all 2 million subordinated
units prior to approval of the proposed amendment to the company's
partnership agreement or if the amendment isn't approved.

As reported, Enron and Koch Petroleum have agreed to convert all 9
million of their outstanding EOTT Energy subordinated units and $9.2 million
of additional partnership interests into about 4.3 million common units.

The company said the shift in capital structure will allow the
company to increase cash distributions to $1.95 a unit from $1.90.

Houston-based EOTT Energy is an energy company that gathers and
markets crude oil and refined products in North America.

INDIA: Panel suggests Indian govt pay in Enron row-paper.

10/01/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
BOMBAY, Oct 1 (Reuters) - An Indian panel has suggested the federal government be willing to spend almost 57 billion rupees ($1.19 billion) to help resurrect the Enron Corp Dabhol power project, which stopped producing electricity more than three months ago, a business daily said on Monday.
The panel was constituted in early 2001 to review all aspects of the controversial power project, set up at a cost of $2.9 billion on the west coast of India.
The Business Standard daily said the panel's report had suggested Dabhol's various stakeholders all be willing to absorb the costs that would have to be incurred to revive the 2,184 MW gas-based project.
Dabhol Power Company is 65 percent owned by Enron Corp . GE and Bechtel own 10 percent each, while the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, a local state-owned power utility, owns the remaining 15 percent.
The western state of Maharashtra is a guarantor to the Dabhol project and the federal government is its counter-guarantor.
U.S.-based Enron has said it wants to exit the project after a bitter dispute with the local utility, which had initially contracted to purchase all the power from Dabhol Power Company's plant.
It subsequently defaulted on payments, saying it didn't need that much power, which it claimed was too expensive in any case. Enron claimed the utility was reneging on its contractual obligations.
Dabhol finally took the utility to the International Court of Arbitration in London, warning India faces liabilities worth $5 billion.
But Enron has simultaneously said it is willing to settle out of court if it can recover its costs.
While there have been many suggestions, the panel's report is among the few to provide a detailed solution, including the liability each party would have to shoulder.
A SOLUTION
The panel was set up by the Maharashtra government. Its main brief was to suggest ways of reworking the power purchase agreement so as to reduce Dabhol's tariff. After the dispute worsened, the panel was also asked to suggest revival measures.
The panel proposed that if all the stakeholders were willing to absorb the specified losses, the tariff on Dabhol's power could be reduced to between 2.25 and 2.4 rupees per kilowatt-hour from 3.65 to 3.91 rupees at 90 percent capacity utilisation, the newspaper reported.
According to the panel's report, the federal government's liability of 56.63 billion rupees included an infusion of 25 billion in cash, waiving customs duties on the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and cutting import duties on capital goods, the report said.
It said the panel has also suggested Enron, GE and Bechtel together absorb a loss of 28.35 billion rupees on their investment in the project. ($1=47.93 rupees).

Rebecca,

As we had spoken on the phone, I met with Mr. KK Sud, a retired Secretary in
the govt. of India yesterday.  This meeting was arranged at Vince's request,
since Vince had been approached by Mr. Sud's son who is a student at Rice
(where Vince teaches a course).  The younger Mr. Sud had wanted someone at
Enron to meet with his father who was visiting Houston, and is currently an
advisor (post retirement from the government) to the Prime Minister's office.

This was my first meeting, and I have no background check on the person.
However, the meeting was interesting, and Mr. Sud conveyed to me in
confidence that the Indian govt. is very interested in solving the Dabhol
issue.  He also conveyed that a decision is being made in the direction of
NTPC buying all the power from Dabhol, but that this was still under wraps.

I have no way of judging the genuineness of this person, but he claimed to
have been Secretary in the Ministry of Defence for some 16 years, which is a
very important post in India.  The information he was conveying seemed so
important that Vince and I decided to update you on the same by phone this
morning.

Mr. Sud is leaving Houston on Monday so, as discussed, I will see if he can
meet with you on Saturday morning.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Please find below some text for Eric's letter.  I hope it is helpful for your development of the letter.  If you have questions or would like some other information, please let me know.  Also, on the question of Enron letterhead, I suppose the desired form of submission is via the web site.  Unless you have electronic letterhead, the issue may be moot.
Martin
Eric Cope worked as a summer associate in the Research Group during the summer of 2001.  During this time, Eric worked on a variety of projects requiring a diverse set of skills.  In all cases, he quickly grasped the scope and context of the problems at hand.  While some direction was given in each case, Eric was often charged with developing the approach details independently, and he executed the tasks very effectively.
One major project for the summer was to develop a web-browser-based trading simulation platform (TSP).  The TSP would create user accounts, require user logons, post simulated market information, post simulated commidity prices, accept and execute buy and sell transactions for users, and track user account information such as positions, order history, and buying power.  The TSP would allow for the use of human users as well as software agent.  Simulated commidity prices could be histroical prices, ficticious calculated prices, or bid/offer prices based on some update algorithms.  The primary goal was to create a framework to test different udpate algorithms and trading strategies.
Eric immediately arranged for the appropriate reference materials to develop the database and associated software infrastructure.  In short order, a simple site was up for users to create accounts and begin "trading" commodities.  The project ended before extensive algorithm evaluation could begin, however, the TSP goes a long way to making such evaluations possible.
Other projects included the development of forecast models for motion picture box office revenues, advertising media placement prices, and long-distance voice telephony prices.  In many of the cases, data were scarce, as were definitive instructions.  Eric analyzed the problem to develop a focused approach, always in consultation and discussion with others, but never with "hand-holding" or intense oversight.  His co-workers and immediate supervisor quickly developed confidence in Eric's ability to take general direction and achieve productive results.  Such confidence and ability is crucial in an environment with limited structure, such as we had.

A termination of equipment associated with the Longview project on or before 10/31/01 will require Enron to write-off approximately $23 million, not inclusive of approximately $3 million in development costs to date.
To extend orders for equipment to 11/30/01 will cost an additional $5.3 million in cancellation charges.
To extend orders for equipment to 12/31/01 will cost an additional $8.7 million (inclusive of the $5.3 million above, therefore, net $3.4 million) in cancellation charges.

Termination at any time between now and year-end 2001 provides no material recovery potential for money spent.

Just wanted to let you know that I had a meeting with Wade Cline (COO, Enron
India), Neil McGregor (President, DPC), and Mohan Gurunath (CFO, DPC) today.
Though I had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your
group, today it became official, and all of them supported the move.  I
explained to them what we would be doing, and the results expected from the
Henwood study.

DPC would like to pay the costs for the study, and that was mentioned.  There
maybe some tax issues etc. that need to be cleared, and other related issues
that I would like to discuss with you, so I will leave them till I get to
Houston.

I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such
a long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to
Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.  I will try to finalize that
before I leave.  I will call you in the evening to just chat.

I am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have.  Things here
have deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks.  Morale is quite down

I am really looking forward to returning to Houston, and the family!!

Vince,

Please see below some of the ideas being bounced, FYI.  Please keep this
confidential.

The unused capacity in Maharashtra should be dispatched on a merchant basis,
ON BEHALF OF MSEB to any customers outside MSEB's current purview.  I would
like us to look at the whole issue as one of MSEB's poor credit, and hence (
as Jeff pointed out on the call), one where we need to identify all deep
pockets in and out of Maharashtra.
Secondly, there is (as Shubh and I had pointed out) the ability to evacuate
about 700-1000 MW to customers other than MSEB.  The challege is - at what
price, and in coordination with which agencies.  As always, in India your
greatest challenge will be in dealing with govt. agencies.
Another point to consider is that in-all we have about 5-7 customers
identified.  Will all the customers we have earmarked bite ???  This is the
reason why systems need to be set up with a bulletin board on pricing 10-15
day power on the screens of the different SEBs we can connect up with.  This
also substantially gets around the credit quality issue, as this would be an
arrangement akin to cash-and-carry.  I see a lot of hope for such a
strategy.  I do not see much hope for a strategy of selling blocks of power
to either NTPC or PTC.  I would agree however, that we not put all our eggs
in one basket, and hence you could designate a team to look into the NTPC
sale issue inparallel.
In order to set up the trading sytems, however, we need to start by the end
of Q1 2001, and just start doing small deals where we break even, simply to
test the waters and introduce liquidity into the market.
Hand-in-hand with this we need a fuel risk management strategy, as I have
been pushing for.  For this to happen, we need to get the Special Import
Licence reinstated.  If that is not possible, we need to lobby with the
highest authorities within govt. and RBi to allow for hedging, irrespective
of whether we have an SIL.  The discussions being held with IOC are therefore
very important in this regard, and I am going to get Anshuman and Mukesh
involved with the same.
Finally, I do not see much hope for your strategy of asking ENE management
for $75 Million to build transmission lines in a country where the regulatory
framework on transmission access is even less defined and understood than the
generation side of the equation.  I would refrain from stating this in any
senior management forum until we are able to clearly demonstrate the
cost-benefit of this.  I have some ideas on that side which I need to develop
further.

Sandeep.

Accounting/Credit Group (Wes, Bill Bradford and others) yesturday, in which
we discussed the best approach for definining credit reserves at year-end for
the puts we own.
2) A big chunck of the meeting was dedicated to explain AA the details of the
deal. Little progress was made on achieving the meeting's goal.
3) Apparently, Accounting did want to expose the calculation we made for puts
value that considers credit risk - the two factor model we developed. That
line of action was implied on a pre-meeting we had early that morning. From
my understanding, Accounting argues that we should not make any credit
reserve because we could not liquidate our position by year-end.
4) At a certain point Jintendra suggested me to use a two factor
MC-simulation for calculating the position with credit risk. The approach is
actually a more simplified version of the model we have. I and nobody
mentioned the results we got from our 2-factor model.
5) At that same afternoon I knew from Accounting that we are in a process of
unwinding our position.

These are the main points. Please let me know if need more details.

As per our discussion, I have done the following to fix the issues with Questar data:

-  dumped data from 02/04/2001 -> present, for all cycles
-  fixed the transform component to pull the proper column for utilized capacity and also to assign the correct effective date for each value
-  re-transformed and re-loaded ALL cycle 5 data (from the *htm files we have)

Now, in loading the 86 or so days back into the DB, approx. 3603 PRIMARY KEY violations were logged...this means that they are duplicating point data within the same day, same cycle, etc.  If this data could be examined more closely in the reports that are subsequently generated, we can make sure that things are truly copacetic from our side (a "surface" scan of the *.htm files shows that they are indeed duplicating points, usually with different names...the utilized capacity associated with these points is the same though, so this doesn't appear to be a big issue, except for the fact that we will continue to have primary key violations being logged).

As always, any questions, just ask.

Thanks,
Chris

This is a summary fo the report submitted by the Godbole Committee appointed

The report clearly suggests renegotiation on the tariff.  A lot of what they

that this can be worked out.

1 Cabinet should have 5 shelves
1 Cabinet should have 6 shelves

When Interstore was here today reconfiguing 2 of our existing cabinets, they removed 8 shelves that they are going to use on these new units.

Please price these 2 new units and charge them to Co. # 0413, RC # 107043.  Please let me the prices and approximate delivery date.  Also, let me  know if you need anything else.  Thanks.  Anita

Wolak makes some good points.  In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing.  I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices.  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

Koch is the agent for IES nominations.

On the accounting side, IES pays their own invoices.  WP&L, Interstate Power, IEA and IES are all under Alliant, but they operate independently.

Kathy Washington currently handles the scheduling for IES since she handles Koch, and also IES accounting since they pay their own invoices.  However, each month Kathy Washington gives the IES invoices to Jean to include with Alliant's mailout.

Hope this explains everything!

Attached is a simple power origination case study that I have developed for use at MBA functions as an alternative to a generic one-hour presentation about Enron.  It will be used for the first time at Georgetown tomorrow.  I thought this tool, or a derivative thereof, could also be useful in early identification of potential "Origination Track" Associates from the Associate pool, as it covers issues related to project development, risk analysis, financial evaluation and debt financing.

I would be happy to think together with you on changes to the case that would enhance its value to the Origination Track program.

Thank you, Joe. If they include combinatorial bids then it would be a much more complicated system. I think everything comes down to liquidity. If they have enough volume, then it will attract even more bidders because the bidders do not have to think too much about the "fair" price because they will always get the lowest successful price anyway. If there is small volume, then it will become harder for the bidders to decide on optimal bidding strategy. Personally I think this system will work because there are many speculators out there who want to play this kind of games.

I am pleased to announce an organisational change within the European Government and Regulatory Affairs Group that will become effective immediately.  Paul Dawson will assume a leadership role for government and regulatory affairs across continental Europe in addition to his current UK responibilities.   Paul will report directly to me and Rick Shapiro and will be strongly supported by the other senior members of the team: Doug Wood, Peter Styles and Paul Hennemeyer.  Richard Lewis and Eric Shaw will continue to work closely with the group along with Rick Shapiro who will continue to provide the team with strategic guidance to ensure that the European Government Affairs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs function.

I believe these changes will enable us to maintain Enron's leadership in regulatory efforts to broaden the markets available to us, to capitalise on regulatory changes and to continue the group's major contribution to our commercial success in the UK and Continental Europe.

The tentative plan is to have me working in the Fundamentals Group.  Of course, as with most things of late, there are no guarantees.  On a different note, I spoke with Alex regarding the load aggregation/portfolio piece.  It was not intended to be part of pSim, but it's development was not completed, so that may not really matter.

An issue has come up that I did not consider in my prior discussions of how bidweek for June should be managed prior to knowing if we close or not.  Physical deals for June have started to happen already.  If close does occur and all the deals prior to May 18th are done as HPL then ENA will miss out on a lot of potential business for June.  So I believe a fair solution is to have all deals in locations that are most relevant to HPL (ie. Agua Dulce, Thompsonville, Oasis Katy, Lonestar Katy, Texoma) be done as HPL; deals in a location such as Katy Tailgate that is relevant to HPL and ENA will be split evenly HPL and ENA and written up as two separate purchases.  Waha is not considered here since AEP already has a Waha trader who is active in the market.

Thanks,

Tom

Louise,
Brett Wiggs is requesting approval for $300,000 in net spend related to what appears to be change orders and a new storage plan for the MHI turbines.  The DASH indicates that this request is made in the name of "Enron Americas".
Is this something that you have discussed with Brett?  In your view, would this be an Enron Americas matter or an EGS matter?   Who presently owns P/L responsibility for the turbines?  At present, EGS is now listed as the "Controlling Party" on the Turbine Position Report.
In any case, I'm fairly certain that a full DASH would not be needed here--an I-DASH would be sufficient and I can work with Brett on that.

I am pleased to announce an organisational change within the European Government and Regulatory Affairs Group that will become effective immediately.  Paul Dawson will assume a leadership role for government and regulatory affairs across continental Europe in addition to his current UK responibilities.   Paul will report directly to myself and Rick Shapiro and will be strongly supported by the other senior members of the team: Doug Wood (Continental Gas), Peter Styles (EU and Continental Power) and Paul Hennemeyer (German speaking countries).  Richard Lewis and Eric Shaw will continue to work closely with the group along with Rick Shapiro who will continue to provide the team with strategic guidance to ensure that the European Government Affairs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs function.

I believe these changes will enable us to maintain Enron's leadership in regulatory efforts to broaden the markets available to us, to capitalise on regulatory changes and to continue the group's major contribution to our commercial success in the UK and Continental Europe.

John,

As we have discussed before, it appears that combining Texas gas and power origination activities is not going to work.  The final nail in the coffin is the fact that in the new building we continue to be on two different floors.  As a result, I would like your thoughts about how to manage the origination activities in Texas.  In my mind there are several possible solutions:
1.  Have Barry Tycholiz manage both the West and Texas origination
2.  Combine EES Texas retail with wholesale under Mark Courtney (EES has been chasing wholesale gas business in Texas)
3.  Have Brian Redmond manage Texas origination (Delainey suggested it; I don't know what you have planned for him but he has contacts with the TRC and 	     customers)

Also, I am continuing to interview for one trader and for one middle marketer with the assistance of Todd Piekert in HR.  He has been identifying third rotation associates for me.  One of the candidates that I have been talking to is Charles Weldon who was approved into the trading track program yesterday.  I am going to talk to him again soon, I would like to be able to have him assigned to my desk either as a trader or originator depending where his skills best fit.  The other candidate is Justin Corrnett.  I have not talked to him yet but I want to know what you thoughts are on all of the above before I go too much farther.

I will get on your calender soon.

Folks,

I am a Vice President with Enron, and have been with the company some 6 years
now.  I was hired through Enron Associate pool, and started off by marketing
power on the East Coast with Jim Fallon.  Currently I am working in the India
Region, looking into different ways to develop merchant type activities in
India, anticipating the start of trading activities some time in the future.
One of my challenges is to make the team in India aware of the type of
sophisticated operations and processes that we have in place for trading
activities, as well as the range of products we have to offer.

I have been in conversation with Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman on the
Global Products side, and are planning a session to acquaint the team in
India with activities in that group.  Similarly, on the power side, we have
been interacting with John Sherriff's team in London.

I feel that it will be very beneficial for some of the team members to get
acquainted with the processes on the power trading side in Houston, and to
get an idea of the RAC process, the Research side, the Back-offices, as well
as the trading operations here.  Similarly, the team there could present to
you the state of the market in India, and give you an idea of the type of
opportunities there.  I am therefore eliciting your support to put together a
session in Houston where they can be acquainted with these functions, as well
as the people responsible for them in the US.  There are three people in the
group who would benefit from this exposure.  One of them is from the
Associate pool, while the other two are people hired locally in India.

I have already spoken with our COO, Wade Cline in this regard, and seek your
support in putting together an agenda for such a session.  Please let me know
who I should contact within your groups to discuss this further.

Regards,
Sandeep.

John,

My suggestion is to have the offsite to be social in nature.  I am sure that many of these people do not know each other and an environment where the group can mingle and enjoy some fun activities would be a great way to become more familiar with each other.  If we must have meetings/presentations, have them done by outside speakers so the group does not have to prepare presentations.  As far as where to go: Austin, San Antonio or Galveston are nice and will be reasonable for a group this size.  If you are ok with spending more the golfing, fishing and Spa activities in Florida (Miami, Key West, Tampa/St. Pete) are great.  Also golfing, rafting and Spa's in Colorado would be good too.

I don't have a strong preference for where we go but I do believe that people would appreciate a focus on fun and getting to know each other.

Vince,

I simply wanted to jot you this note because I find that I am sometimes able to address things better in writing than in a conversation.

I want to convey my thanks to you for putting up with me through this period.  I guess I was a bit shell shocked after seeing the project I had worked on, and the team I had built from scratch just going down in a matter of days, not to mention the changes on the personal side.  Through this period you offered me the type of support that perhaps no one else would have, and I want to say that I really appreciate it.

Over this period I got so entangled in my own problems and worries that I forgot that leadership is all about caring for others and not yourself.  My house is now in order, and I am back to my old self.  I want to offer you my full support at this time, and am at your service on whatever issue it is that you wish me to take up.  The company is facing trying times, and I would like to help in whatever way I can.

Please do put as much pressure on me as you would like.  I promise that I will push myself to the limit.  I am ready for the commitment to learn new skills, and have already been doing this, though it has been a slow process.  I will require yours and others guidance from time to time, but will be ready for anything you suggest.

Regards,
Sandeep.

PS:
I have written Paula a note (after our conversation yesterday), and will follow up with her.
I am going to send out a mail today to celebrate my daughter's first birthday, and would like you to keep the 11th of November free!

Lance and I spoke with Tim Heizenrader regarding modeling work and needs for
the West Desk.  The differences in the markets between East and West are, in
Tim's opinion, sufficient that he does not need an approach as sophisticated
as the one we are pursuing for ERCOT.  In particular, the termal limits for
which load flows are so useful are not generally binding in the West.  Loop
flows are also not considered a major issue at present.

In summary, it seems that the West is an unlikely customer of any extension
to an ERCOT/East transmission model for the time being.  They have also done
little in this area that would directly relate to our efforts here.

Vince,

I was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to Jeff Shankman
about, in the Dabhol LNG context.  It occurred to me that one way to collect
on regas charges, and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the
railways.

Some time back, I had looked into the possiblility of transporting LNG by
train.  Apparently, technology exists wherein LNG can be put into cryogenic
containers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded
from trucks to train bogies.  I believe this maybe a way to earn some monies
with LNG by developing just such a market in India for Commercial customers.

It is pertinent to note that the Konkan Rail line is just about 1 hr. 45
minutes from the Dabhol plant.  Trucks from Dabhol could carry LNG to the
rail line at Guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of
India.  If we target end-consumers directly, we could easily sell at retail
type prices, and build in a large margin, even if the volumes disposed are
relatively smaller.  (The alternative fuel for most of these establishments
is diesel or naphtha which is highly priced, and mostly trucked along
roads,increasing costs).  The end aim is to keep income targets in India, so
that the Analysts do not have a field day with the stock.

Hence keeping activity up in India, and showing that solutions exist, will
keep stock price buoyed.  We could explore this idea if it appeals!

Sandeep.

Folks,

I am forwarding this in order for the team to focus on the naphtha issue.
Please note that:

As Phase II comes on line, Blocks B and C will first have to run on naphtha
for a period of 3-6 months
This will hit us some time in 2001, hence is a more urgent issue than LNG,
which is still a year away
If there are delays in the commissioning of the Regas terminal, the period on
naphtha could further prolong
The naphtha market is more volatile than the crude market, and is not as
deep, hence we need to take small positions early on to test the market
DPC Board has already approved a Risk Management Policy that allows for
hedging.  We may need to look into options that are costless (selling put and
buying call) to begin with, and test while only Block A is in place.
Close coordination will be required on this with the Global Markets group,
and I propose someone like Anshuman should actually be seconded onto the group
A whole plan on tools to manage the fuel risk need to be worked in close
coordination with the team on the ground

These are just some of my thoughts.  With 50% of the tariff being fuel price
dependent, this is an area that requires close attention.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Neil,
You must have already gotten my earlier mail of clarification.  Going
forward, I agree with you that we should start the assigment early rather
than late.
However, I would not necessarily like to wait till even Feb 5.  The bids for
LNG must go out by the 15th of Feb, and we need to do a lot of fuel based
analysis before then.  Hence, if it is possible for Anshuman ot be available
before then, I would greatly appreciate it.  Perhaps even as early as Monday
or Tuesday if possible ??

There is a system issue that came up today with the Internal Product Types.
In the review process, if you set the Internal Product Types to "None",
counterparties are still able to read the products.   To prevent this from
happening on future reviews, I recommend the following:

New Counterparties
I will pull the counterparty into Datamanager and set the profile to "Read"
for everything and delete the Internal and ZZ Product Types
Credit should continue to review for the specific commodity requested for
Trade
Legal/Contracts should only review the product types that Credit has selected
for Trade.  The remaining product types are already set to Read with the
exception of the Internal and ZZ Product Types.

Amended Counterparties
Initial group will amend product types - excluding the Internal and ZZ
product types
Other groups updating the work queue - Please make sure to exclude the
Internal and ZZ product types in your review.

This is short term - Once we release the new version of Profile Manager -
Internal Product Types will not be included in your reviews.

We appreciate your cooperation with this request.  Please let me know if you
have any questions.

Durasoft (the company that did the Java class) will be holding a course on
COM object programming for Enron Networks.  COM allows for programs to be
written such that they are available for execution to other programs on a
language independent basis.  Several Research members are interested in this
technology.

The class is $15,000 for 15 people and NetWorks has a few spaces that are
unfilled.  We can send a few people, therefore, for about $1000 each.  The
course is May 14-18 (which conflicts with the EPRM 2001 Conference), so they
need a total soon.

Is this course something group members can sign up for?

FYI.  This could be quite important for us.  Through forming a tradinf co. we
could be brokering deals on behalf of MSEB, without letting them off the hook.

In this manner we could be doing short term deals and increasing despatch
from Dabhol or other MSEB marginal units.  Any money flowing from these sales
should go into an escrow account that goes directly towards payment of DPC
bills.

In this manner we would be increasing the payment ability of MSEB.

We appeared to have some problems with a couple of web sites on Saturday
evening / Sunday afternoon.  Unfortunately, I was not home at that time to
be able to reset them.  Upon returning home this evening (Sunday), I took a
look and the following cycles did not get scraped:

05/19/2001
Kern, Cycles 2 & 4
Transco Cycle 2

05/20/2001
KM (Points R & D, Segments) Cycle 2
Transcolorado (R & D, Segments) Cycle 2
Kern, Cycle 3
Northwest, Cycle 6

I have reset all of the jobs...unfortunately, I suspect there is data loss
for the above cycles. One of our "old friends", the 1line Williams site, is
definately the cause for the Northwest, Kern and Transco misses.  This site
still appears to be having problems, so it should be checked for the next
couple of days.  When trying to go to it tonight, I received various errors,
and the general site layout appeared different since the last time I looked
(this means they could potentially change the layout of the page we get data
from as well).

As I write this, "capture" jobs for Kern, Northwest, and Transco are failing
due to "Internal Server Errors".

Hopefully, this is a short-term problem, and these sites will stabilize
soon.  The bright side of this story is that the Jaguar system did exactly
what it was supposed to do when these problems occur...it retried until the
job attempts seemed fruitless, then it sent pages to report the problems.

I took the large spreadsheet of data that we had before, and sorted the data
so that I could just look at trades that took place off-peak (between 6:00 PM
and 8:00 AM). Then, I sorted this data by counterparty, and looked at Hess's
trading against us. It seems as though there are several clear occasions when
they were bidding the price up, as shownin the graph within the spreadsheet.

Apologies to anyone I did not include on the mail I sent earlier today...

As a recap, we had some issues this weekend with Questar, Overthrust, and
one cycle each of Kinder Morgan and Transcolorado.

I reset all failed jobs this afternoon, and Overthrust appears to still be
having problems as I write this...cycles 1 and 3 for Overthrust have failed
again, due to web site errors.

As stated previously, we should look into attempting to recover missed data
for the afforementioned pipes as soon as possible.  Also, a call to
Overthrust might be in order, to see if they expect any more down time.

FYI. update on movie trading business.
I change my mind. At first I though that we should focus on customers who
want to diversify their unique risks. But now I feel that, at this moment,
the "make-sense" people are not easy to find in reality. (Even myself who own
Enron stock, not Dynergy.) There are more risk takers than risk diversified
people. So I think speculators might be our customers in this movie business.

Jim,

Please find attached some slides that show the results of the Henwood run
giving dispatch for the Dabhol plant within Maharashtra.  I have also sent
the presentation we made to you to Wade.  He is to get back on when would be
an appropriate time for him to go over the presentation with me.

Vince, Stinson and I have placed ourselves on Rebecca's calender for Friday,
and we will make the complete pitch to her.  It would be great if you too
could be present at the meeting.  If it is possible, please do let me know.

On the attached slides, please note that:
The slides all assume that there is a 1 part power tariff, MSEB liability for
the entire capacity payment is not considered.
The Henwood model was with no power flowing out of Maharashtra
When variable O&M costs, fixed O&M cost plus fuel costs increased beyond 5
cents/kWh (equal to MSEB's average realization), load went unmet
In 2002 the slide shows the monthly dispatch from Dabhol in equivalent MW
terms, and also the load shedding in Maharashtra
We cross-checked the Henwood run load shedding data against actual hourly
load shedding data from 1999-2000 that we had from MSEB
My estimate is that for December and January the load shedding maybe more
than what the Henwood model shows, but overall the run passes the laugh test
The graph also shows the monthly bill (based on 7.21 cents/kWh) that MSEB
would have to pay for the DPC dispatch.
The next slide shows our estimate of MSEB's payment capability (range from
$38-46 MM/month)
The Henwood run shows an average bill for 2002 to be $41 MM/month; though in
some months (Jan) it goes as high as $69 MM.  Hence, overall, MSEB can pay
for the dispatches as shown in the Henwood run provided, they are not paying
for the capacity payment for the whole 2184 MW plant.
In conclusion, therefore, MSEB has the need for between 1200 to 410 MW on a
seasonal basis.  This means that the power remaining to be sold to other
states is the difference between that and 2184 MW.
However, since the demand within Maharashtra varies seasonally, it may mean
that we need to market seasonal products to other states, not long term
blocks.

These are our conclusions.  We may continue to work some more on the fuel and
hedging side.  If you have any more questions for me, please let me know,
else for now there will not be any new Henwood runs.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Vince/Stinson,

The note below gives us the authorization to proceed.  I have received no
comments from Wade on my signing, but I have his approval for the study, so I
will proceed on that basis.

Since we do not have any format of confidentiality agreement from Jim, let us
use the one signed by the legal team for the Japan study by Henwood.  In this
reference, could you (Stinson) get this from either Heather Mitchell, or John
Viverito (who is the lawyer involved with Japan, reporting to Alan
Aronowitz).  We could use that as template and proceed before Friday on that
basis.

Regards,
Sandeep.
