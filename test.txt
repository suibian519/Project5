next Monday, the 18th.  We will put everything out in one of the

I'm concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance that we've built up again.  Tim - are these numbers verified and up to date.  Can I get a breakdown of the 1.5 Bcf and the 700 MMcf current month portion.   It seems like we just worked down these balances in the fall and now we're building these balances back up again.
If these supply imbalances are building up as a result of Phase V outages perhaps the payback gas use should be separately captured and recorded against the project.

Attached is an inactivation of Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, L.P., CP ID

Per the March 2001 report, this entity converted to a limited liability
company.    We did not receive any documentation at that time.  Ten days
later, it converted again to a limited partnership.  Per our normal
procedures, a new record was created for the limited partnership.  The "Inc"
record was to be inactivated on 04/02/01.  In the meantime, a legal opinion
was issued to state that this should be treated as a name change and that an
overlay should be done.  I have overlayed the "Inc" record with "LP", and the
newly created LP record, CP ID 93330 will be inactivated.

you were in meetings and had been very busy, I did not know whether your

Additional information on the Transco MarketLink shippers:

Shipper   Phase  Volume  Term  Delivery Pt  Rate

Aquila   I     25,000 Dthd 10 years Manhattan  $0.35
Consolidated Edison I     30,000  10  Manhattan  $0.35
ConEdison Energy I     10,000  10  Manhattan  $0.35
St. Lawrence Cement I       1,000  10  Camden, NJ  $0.30
Williams Energy I  100,000  10  Manhattan/PSEG $0.35
Virginia Power  II  100,000  10  Trenton-Woodbury $0.30
PPL Energy Plus II     30,000  10  Princeton Junction $0.18

Phase 1 begins 11/1/01.  Phase II begins 11/1/02.  The rates shown are for
the demand and are the rates that Transco had been marketing for the
project.  Each shipper is responsible for fuel and the electric power
commodity charge and ACA.  There will be no GRI or Great Plains commodity
surcharges.  The Manhattan and PSEG delivery points are Transco Zone 6 NY
points.  The Camden, Trenton-Woodbury and Princeton Junction points are
non-NY.
Williams reduced their precedent agreement volume from 210,000 Dthd to the
100,000 Dthd.  Williams' rights to PSEG points are north of the Linden
allocation point.  Virginia Power is buying a project from Statoil on the
Trenton-Woodbury line.  Virginia Power's commitment to MarketLink replaces
one of Statoil's two precedent agreements.  Statoil has also sold another
project that was underlying their second precedent agreement.  The new and
unnamed project owner has requested and been granted an extension to the
90,000 Dthd precedent agreement for a later phase of MarketLink.  Sunset
Energy Fleet has requested and been granted an extension for their 95,600
Dthd precedent agreeement.  LFG, a landfill gas developer, has also been
granted an extension of their 5,000 Dthd precedent agreement to enable LFG to
finalize a sale with a new owner or to locate an alternative landfill site.
PPL Energy Plus has the right to deliver into a proposed new interconnect
with PPL Interstate Energy Company pipeline system in Lower Mt. Bethel
Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania or a proposed new interconnect
with PPL's Eden plant in East Drumore Township, Lancaster County,
Pennsylvania on a primary basis.  They also have the right to extend their
agreement at the $0.18 rate for an additional two five year terms.  Dynegy
(30,000 Dthd) and Engage (210,000 Dthd) terminated their respective precedent
agreements.  Due to these terminations and reductions,  Transco only has
announced precedent agreements of 190,600 Dthd for later phases.  If these
precedent agreements become contracts, MarketLink would have 486,600 Dthd of
shipper volume.  Transco has stated that all 700,000 Dthd of MarketLink would
be built by 11/01/04.

Good morning all.  We apologize that we are not going to be able to have
our Holiday Party before the first of the year.   We wanted to use the Scout
House in West University like we did last year and it was not available.

Vince suggested that with the move and a lot of people taking vacation that
we wait until after the first of the year.  This way you can take advantage
of
"after Christmas sales"  for your gift!

Just remember whose name you have and we will schedule an "offsite"
after the first of the year.

Thanks!

Attached is the preliminary report for March, 2001.  Please note that there
are overlays that were completed in the system TODAY, but most were completed
prior to this distribution and notification was sent at the time the changes
were made.

Please also note that I will be out of the office tomorrow, so I will make
the shortname changes in GCP this evening, after 5:p.  ERMS IT will make its
changes tomorrow morning, Friday, March 16.

Records will be inactivated on April 2, 2001.

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly
reformatted.  Key points are:
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format,
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

All,

As many of you already know, I decided to take a position at EES, so this week suppose to be my last week in the Gas Fundamentals Group.
It is a pretty satisfactory feeling to the reporting team and myself that we are able to contribute to the success of gas trading by providing over
100 reports every day. I certainly appreciated all your help, cooperation and friendship. Needless to say it was a great experience to work with
you all.

At Dave Dronet's request I'll stay one more week to transit my responsibilities to Kim Alexsander next week. Kim will lead the reporting team
and continue provide the excellent support to you all. The reporting team is in good hands. Even after I move to another group,
I am just a phone call away, I'll let you know my new phone # and continue to help you wherever I can.

Thanks....

I've heard through the grapevine that pipelines (not GPG) are already
complaining that there
is  "nothing in it for pipelines."   I think we should be cautious about

The AUD 5000 invoice was sent to the accounting department but they
sent it back saying they cannot pay invoices in foreign currency.  So I then
had to send it to the Treasury Dept.  I will check on it today also.

As far as the other invoice.   It should be sent to our Australia office to

Rick, Mike and Jodie, we reviewed the attached recommendation and wanted to pass on
an idea to you. On NNG, we are trying to ensure new or existing meters do NOT come on without
a schedule volume to ensure proper billing.  Since TBS' on NNG do not always have a scheduled
volume tied to it, we may need to ensure the volume is covered at the Zone level by the shipper.
Do you think this is something the Measurement Desk could help the field with?  We certainly
would be glad to help in any way on the scheduling side. This is especially important for new meters
as we go through the billing process.
Just a thought.  Thanks. Lynn

Clifford:

In reviewing our February EIS Billing Summary for Co#0413, CC#107043,
I have several questions.

Telerate: (February charges: $3,032,35)
I polled the group and only one person has asked for Telerate and he is
not shown being charged for it.    That is Jason Sokolov.  He would like to
have access to Telerate.  If you could let me know how to get that for him.

The largest percent of the Telerate charges appear to be for Maureen
Raymond, who says that she does not use Telerate.  Could she be accessing
some data that she does not know is Telerate?  Please let me know.  If there
are individual accounts for Telerate the only one we need is for Jason
Sokolov,
unless Maureen's charges are for something that she does not know is Telerate.
Tanya Tamarchenko does not need Telerate and she has the second largest
percentage of the charges.  Anyway, the only Telerate subscription we need is
for Jason Sokolov.

Reuters: (February charges:  $405.96)
No one in Research uses Reuters.  I believe most of the charges are for
Hector
Campos who used it when he was on the trading desk.  When he rotated into the
Research group he did not need it any longer, but is still being billed for
it.  Please
remove from the Research Cost Center.

The following individuals are no longer with Enron or no longer with Research
and their accounts should be removed from the Research Cost Center.

Clayton Vernon  No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL
and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center
Brad Amoine  No longer with Enron   Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL and LIM Core
charges from the Research Cost Center
Shalesh Ganjoo No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM and LIM Core
charges from the Research Cost Center

I hope this is not too confusing!

All:

As you all know that the DRN within a pipeline should be unique, the DRN_description should be too. Otherwise
it will cause aggregation errors in our reports, values with the same DRN_description within a pipeline are all summed
together. I have created a query called qry_Mulri_DRN_Names in the Access database O:\Fundy_ops\ReportSetting.mdb (Access 2000),
You can run this query to find out how many duplicates there are, and which pipeline they are. If you entered those duplicates,
you can work with Hyde or Eddie to have them corrected. Please also pay special attention when you enter new DRN and their
descriptions. The rule is No Duplicate DRN or DRN descriptions are allowed within the same pipeline.
When in doubt, you can always run the query mentioned above to check duplicates.

Let me know if you have questions. Thanks.

Guys,

I am really glad that the report generations were working fine during the period when I was away,
thanks to the efforts of Kim, Lindon and Angela. But I am so sad that you don't have to have me around anymore for your reports ...

Hereby I'd like to give you an update on a few issues we fixed/fixing.
a) Code has been added to show the Storage balance in the historical report instead of average
b) Because OLAP cube interprets Null as 0 value, we saw monthly average to be 0 but actually should be Null,
we've added code to detect Null value so that "NA" will be shown for monthly average rather than 0.
c) Some pipeline (e.g. PGE) broadcast forward (future) flow, so in the end of the month, the latest month in Time
dimension of the cube does not indicate the correct one. For instance, today is May. 31, the latest month in Time
dimension is already June, which cause problems in historical report. It has been fixed.
e) Central historical reports have been made fit to one page, and extra sheets on the interactive ones have been removed.

Matt: In order for the above items to take effect please verify with the executable Kim give you and let us know so that we can use it to replace
the one currently used for report generation.

Another thing I talked with Matt was the Maximum Capacity column. I understand that you'd like to remove that column for reports which do
not report this value, however it involves big structure change to take one column away. I am wondering if we can put "NA" or use some other wording
such as "not reported" instead to save coding time and structure change. I need your feedback on this.

One last item is that I checked the log for both daily and historical report and noticed that there are still quite some points their report setting are not quite
right. Please take a look at the attached, if it is a report you are responsible, make sure the settings are right so we don't see error in the log.

Thanks, I'll try to write short email next time.

Hello Kenneth:

Nice talking to you this morning!  Below is your interview schedule for
Monday, Oct. 30th and directions to the Enron Bldg..  Please let me know
if you need any travel arrangements made.

Coming from the northwest part of Houston, your best bet would be to
take I-45 into town.  There is quite a bit of construction downtown, so you
will probably have to take the McKinney exit from I-45 (you will need to
stay in the left lane as you approach town.  Exit McKinney to Smith Street,
take a right on Smith Street go to Andrews Street, take a right on Andrews
(the Enron bldg. is on the left), pass the Enron Bldg. cross "Ruthvan" (1st
stop sign) and pull into the Allen Center Parking garage (Visitors area on
your right).  Come to the security desk on the 1st floor of the Enron Bldg.
and ask for me.  They will call me and I will meet you in the elevator lobby
on the 19th floor.

Monday, October 30th

9:00 AM  Vince Kaminski, Managing Director, Research
9:30 AM  Zimin Lu, Director
10:00 AM Vasant, Vice President
10:30 AM Krishna Krishnarao, Director
11:00 AM Paulo Issler, Manager
11:30 AM Stinson Gibner (He will take you to lunch)
1:00 PM  Molly McGee (HR Recruiter)

Have a safe trip.

Thank you for taking time to come to our Gas Logistics Staff meeting on Tuesday.  My apologies to those individuals that were inadvertently dropped from the email distribution.  I will schedule time to visit with anyone that missed the staff meeting.

I know that you are all still searching for answers to the Enron events of the last few weeks.   You asked lots of good questions at the meeting.  At the bottom of this email are responses to a few additional questions.  As I said at the meeting, while I am discouraged by recent events, I am really proud of ETS and of our Gas Logistics Team and I am looking forward to showing off our pipeline successes to the Dynegy management team in the future.

With the Thanksgiving holiday just around the corner, I'd like to take the opportunity to wish you and your family a safe and happy holiday season.  I hope that you can spend time with your families and friends away from the demands of work.  I'd also like to put two dates on your calendar to celebrate work accomplishments with our team.

Team Celebration.  First, I hope you can attend a celebration on November 29 at the Doubletree honoring the Gas Logistics team and the new Contracts/Capacity Release team.  The celebration will include food, games and prizes.  Alma Carillo will be sending out all the details.
Holiday Luncheon.  Second, get out your recipe books and start cooking, because it's also time for our Gas Logistics Holiday Banquet on December 11th in ECN42C2 from 11:30am - 1:30pm.  I'll provide the ham and turkey and team members can sign-up to bring a covered dish.  Ricki Winters will send around a sign-up sheet to make sure that we don't end up with 10 green bean casseroles.

Hello Ainsley:

We are so glad you are interested!  I spoke with Vince Kaminski and the
procedure is to usually conduct a telephone interview first.  This will let
us know exactly where your interests are and establish where you might
fit within our organization.

Please let me know your availability and the best time to reach you on
Thursday (the 25th) or Friday (the 26th) afternoon from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm.

Also please let me have the telephone number where you may reached
and we will call you.  It is easier that way since there will be several of
us involved in the interview.  The interview will usually last an hour or an
hour and a half.

Thank you Ainsley!

Please find attached the Final Name Change/Merger Notification Report for
April 2001.  To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select
Enable Macros and Read Only.
Please note that:
ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central
Time, and
Inactivations will be made on May 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly
reformatted.  Key points are:
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format,
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring
process.


Please call me with any questions or concerns.

Hello everyone:

Thanks to Krishna we have come up with a plan that I believe is going to
save everyone some time.   We have created an Excel Spreadsheet, with
the time sheet form, and there is a tab for each of you, in alphabetical
order
by first name across the bottom of the spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet is saved in O:\Research\Common\SAP Timesheets\MMM-DD.
(MMM = month and DD = 15th or end of the month time period - i.e., this time
period is 7/16 - 7/31/00).  The regular 8 hour days have already been entered
for each of you.  Therefore, if you have no exceptions you just need to type
in
your name in the bottom right corner by the place marked (Emp Sign), and save
it.

If you do have exception time, simply open that particular pay period and
show the exception time (off-duty,vacation, overtime, sick time, jury time,
family
time, etc.) that you may have had during that pay period.  Some of the codes
have already been entered for you, the rest are listed at the bottom of the
spreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever
applies.

If you are an exempt employee you need only show your off-duty time
or exception time.  If you are non-exempt you must show all hours worked
and if you have overtime, you must add that to the 8 hours regular time.
There is no code for non-exempt overtime.

This should make it much easier for everyone.  However, I will need you to
fill out this timesheet form by the 13th and 29th of each month.  I will
try and remind you by email the day before.

I would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation, HOD day, or any
other
off-duty that you know about before hand, that way if you are out of pocket
for any
reason and cannot fill in one of the forms,  I will be able to fill in your
timesheet for you.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know.

Thanks!

Attached is the FINAL Name Change/Merger report for March 2001.  Please note
that the most recent overlays are on top because unlike the others, prior
notification has not been given.  These were just done last night and this
morning.  For the complete report, go to the bottom tab, "March 2001".

The shortname changes will be coordinated with ERMS IT today, Fri, 03/23/01.

Records will be inactivated on Mon, April 2, 2001.

FYI - On the Feb 2001 report, there were several PG&E entities that went
through name changes to El Paso entities.  There were also 3 TECO
conversions.  We did not have the documentation to support those changes, as
noted on the report.  As of 03/22/01, all documentation for those changes are
in hand.

Regarding the Coastal/El Paso merger, the documents that support name changes
as a result of that merger, have been received.  If you are interested in
more details regarding the remaining entities, they are attached below.

Maureen Raymond Castaneda is officed in EB1939.  She has terrible migraine
headaches which are made worse by light.  We would like to get a price on
having an on/off switch installed in her room.  As of now, they have removed
the light bulbs, but said that may not completely answer the problem as some
one may see that they are out and request they be replaced.

I think the answer (if it is not too expensive) would be to have a switch
installed.

Guys,

Some of you have noticed that on many of today's reports, we are able to see flow value for a meter for 5/1/2000, but the MDT column showed
"na" on the daily report. "na" is also shown on the historical report for the average of May.  It is very easy to get confused (at least I was in the beginnieng, even
though I wrote the program myself) when you see things like this, you may ask why isn't the average the value shown for today since there is
only one day's data? The answer is that they are from different cycles. Coding used the business logic that grab the flow value from the latest
successful cycle,  while always use the last cycle when deal with average. At the time of report generation if the last cycle is not available, this will
happen. Fortunately this only happens on the first day of each month.

Please explain this to those who may raise this question when they see this "discrepancy".

Per our discussions today, here is my understanding of the status of the
implementation of the PGAS calculation for 31 Day Charts and & Meter Cards.

Beginning with March Production (April Billing), GMS will have the new
calculation in PGAS for 31 Day Charts and Meter Cards.  This calculation
is to give NNG a better daily number to bill the customer.  Once the
31 Day Charts are in, then they will be delineated with the fixed
delineator.  The meter cards will use the calculation only.

At this time there will NOT be a daily PGAS calculation for 7 day and 16 day
charts.  These charts will be (1) tracked for timely receipt; and (2) integrated for
daily volumes when received.

Any charts received after the required deadline, will be processed as a PPA.

any questions, please let Gary or I know.  Thanks. Lynn

Hello all:

Unfortunately, in the last two weeks we have had two of our Research "chairs"
disappear from their location.  We have reported this to Security, but in all
likelihood they will be almost impossible to locate.

Facilities has told us that they are not responsible for missing chairs and we
will have to order new ones.   Since they are very expensive,  we have
decided to "mark" our chairs underneath the seat with a location or name.
Sam is going to order some "silver or white" markers and we will begin
marking
each chair.

It is a shame we have to do this, but know of no other alternative.  We will
let you
know when this will take place.

Thanks!

Please Send to ETS Gas Logistics Staff (Excluding Midland Control)

Please plan to join me on Wednesday, November 28 from 2-3 in 39C1 for a Gas Logistics staff meeting.  We will discuss company updates as well as questions about the PEP system.

In addition, I have arranged for HR to conduct a training session on Effective Performance Feedback on Thursday, November 29 in Room ECN 5C2 from 1pm-3pm.  Roger Sumlin of the ETS Performance Improvement group will lead the session.  The concepts and techniques covered will help you be more effective in any feedback situation, such as providing feedback in PEP and in interactions with team members.  Roger will talk about what affects a person's openness to feedback and what a feedback giver needs to do to meet the feedback receiver's needs.   He will also review examples of good and bad statements entered in PEP and performance evaluation forms and talk about the importance of providing specific, useful and honest feedback that includes behavioral examples.   This session is voluntary, but I hope that you will take advantage of the opportunity to improve feedback effectiveness.  Please contact Tonja Trevino by Tuesday, November 27 to enroll in the session.  You may e-mail Tonja at <mailto:tonja.trevino@enron.com> or phone her at x30412.

Happy New Year Louise.   Hope things are going okay down in Houston with the bidding process for NetCo. etc., and that you were able to take some holiday.   I want to thank you again for facilitating my transfer back to Canada.  I was really enjoying working in the Toronto office; the people are impressive and the opportunity in the Ontario market is definitely massive and exciting.
For now, I'm going to be working on the 'estate' side of things for Enron Canada, but meanwhile, I've also started investigating some interesting opportunities outside (i.e. retail opportunities, online platforms, etc.).
Anyway, per below, are you okay with ENRONDIRECT.CO.UK getting transferred over to Centrica ?
Please let me know when you get a chance.  All the London IT guys that were dealing with this appear to be gone, so I'll follow up as appropriate.

All:

Just as a follow up to the mail I sent yesterday, what I found out this morning is that all reports generation based on
the 1st cub processing are successful, after I moved the cube processing time back to 2:30 AM. This probably tells
us that we need to leave enough time between the last scraping  and the cube processing, although what caused
the blow-up yesterday is still mysterious. The lesson is when it is working, do not make changes, or it may break.

There are still a  few format issues I need to fix.

Tom Brown Resources Ltd., CP ID 96309 is the result of an amalgamation with
Stellarton Energy Corporation, CP ID 64040.  Stellarton Energy Corporation
will be inactivated on 05/01/01.  Have Certificate of Amalgamation and
Articles of Amalgamation in hand.

Please also note that the Western Area Power Administration-"Upper Great

Administration-"Upper Great Plains Region".  The record that was overlayed
per the report, CP ID 35194, will be inactivated as a duplicate record.

Thanks for the info.  I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.   FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by the volume.  I made the appropriate changes on Galen's spreadsheet.


A couple of further things that I need:
- I need to reconcile the net volume on Galen's sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on Jim's sheet.  There are huge differences.  Can these really all be receipt imbalances?

Galen for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances.   We are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances.


Let me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this.  I need to get Teb my final analysis by the end of the week.

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's
organization
and the Research Group.

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish
transfer
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project
in the future.

We are inviting Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon to this meeting. We would
appreciate if you could
speak, together with Kevin and Ken, on strategic directions of EBS. It is
important for a group
of technical people, with relatively specialized technical skills, to
understand the big picture.

I am attaching the preliminary agenda for this meeting.

I am dropping you this e-mail at the request of Rod Hayslett and in response to your voice mail message to him concerning the status of the price redetermination under the LNG contract with Duke.  The parties reached settlement on this issue about a week before arbitration.  The new price beginning September 1 is 92.5% of the Equivalent MMBtu Price of No. 6 Fuel Oil less $0.25 per
MMBtu.  Of course, the other provisions of the contract,  such as the ceiling price, the floor price and the bank provisions,  remain.

The question has arisen as to whether Enron has "personal days", that,
you can take in case of repair problems at home; car problems; sick spouse,
sick child, etc.
I checked with HR and the Policy Manual and the answer is "no", but they
can be designated at the discretion of the supervisor.  I talked this over
with Vince and he has decided that the Research Group will be allowed
two (2) personal days per year to take care of personal business and
not have to take a vacation day, discretionary day, or leave of absence.
If you have advance notice (such as an air conditioner repair scheduled),
please let me know when you are going to take these days.  If an
emergency arises with no notice, please call in and let me know that you
are taking a personal day.  It will be coded on your time sheet.
These two personal days will in no way cancel or take the place of, "funeral
leave", "family leave", or "civic duty leave".  They are just a way of being
able to take care of repair problems and other personal problems that arise.
These should be very beneficial and I am sure very much appreciated by
all of us.
If you have any questions, please call me.

Should we be talking about make up when we are allocating Belleville?  I had a question from Alliant,
"You, NNG and ANR both have room to deliver gas to ANR, even though you are doing an allocation,
why can't you schedule more delivery at ANR?  Wouldn't that help the system?"  I think it would be
hard to explain that we are doing make up, allocating and NOT letting a shipper increase deliveries all
at the same time.  What do you guys think?  Thanks. Lynn

Hello all:

Bad news!  Most of the really nice restaurants in Breckenridge close on the
22nd of April.  We may have to have all the dinners at the hotel.  Do you
have
any other suggestions?

I will check with Scott Yeager's wife again today to see if she perhaps knows
of another good restaurant that may be open, but the owner of Pierre's told
me most of them close and open again for the summer season in  May.

Thanks!

Hope you had an enjoyable Thanksgiving!

I found out the "scoop" on the ticket.  It was non-refundable and non-

Maureen's husband used.

I will send in a check request for reimbursement in the amount of $330.50.
The best thing would be for you to go ahead and pay the bill or wait for
the check from us.

Sorry for the confusion!

I just listened to the presentation on the GISB final rule on intraday recalls.

The final rule requires pipelines to support intraday recalls and allow the recalling shipper to nominate at each nomination cycle, but the implementation of the rule will be in two phases:

1. By May 2002, pipelines must file tariff revisions to be effective July 2002 to permit recalls at the evening cycle or for capacity which was not being used by the replacement shipper.

2. With respect to recalls during the flowing gas day, the Commission directs NAESB (GISB) to file comments by October 2002 on how these recalls should be accommodated, with reply comments by October 15.

Commissioner Massey noted that some parties claimed the new rule would undercut reliability.  Staff responded that if a shipper is worried about partial day recallability, then they should buy capacity release packages that are not designated as partial day recallable.  The releasing shipper can decide whether to offer the space with partial day recall rights or not.

The discussion of the order seems to be in step with ETS pipeline 637 proposals to only allow intraday capacity release/recall at the timely and evening cycles at this time and say that we would need to build additional validations and need more time if required to allow recalls during the flowing gas day.  The fact that comments aren't even being filed on phase 2 until Oct.  -- I think we're safe to assume that this phase won't be implemented until 2003.

Please have Greg approve these as soon as possible.

The Wharton School will be cross-charged to Christie Patrick's cost center.

Vince:
I was confused also - but I think this is the computer we ordered for
the new employee that is coming next week (Rakesh Bharati).  Phillip our
IT floor tech said that the computer in the back room at EB1972G was very
old and did not have much memory so I ordered a new one with an
upgrade to bring it up to 196M (this is what Phillip said we need).  Also
there
is another computer back there that does not have much memory and we
ordered an upgrade for it (Jason's).  I went ahead an did it so that they
would
be ready when the new employees come in.
Maureen already has her upgrade.

Follow-Up Q/A

Can Employees still order computers from the Click at Home program?
As of today, the Click at Home program has not been cancelled.  The web site is working and eligible employees are able to place orders.

Regarding loans from the Saving Plan, is there any requirement for accelerated loan payment if the value of the loan exceeds the current value of the savings plan account?
For active employees, loan payment amounts will not change during the term of the loan, even if the outstanding balance of the loan exceeds the value of the account.

Does the company have any position on employee participation in class action suits?
No.  The decision whether to participate in a suit is a personal decision and is unrelated to an individual's employment.
**EOM**
576
**START**
FYI.  I would still like the On Call TW Scheduler to dial in at 8:00 a.m. on Saturday

If there are major concerns, we will probably not discuss them until the NNG
meeting is over and the NNG Marketers are off the phone line.  At that time
we can call the On Call TW Marketing Rep if needed.

There is new information in our TEAM PROCEDURE BOOK ( The White Binder that has our lovely team picture on it) This information includes plant procedures for locations that NNG does not have set control on. This is a guideline that the after hours / weekend rep can use as a reference when gas controls calls with a problem. The phone numbers and contacts are up to date,  however some of the plant names should be updated. I'll work on that part next. Joe and I will also put this information in a common folder so the team can update and can keep things current. This will be in the book tabbed "PLANT PROCEDURES" . remember these are locations NNG has no set control.

The following is the procedure Gas Logistics and Marketing have agreed to beginning this weekend to
segregate the TW and NNG morning meeting.
1.  TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting.
2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions.
3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 18 , 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance.
4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting.
5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday.
6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.
If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.
I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.
Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.

We have duplicate records in the system.

Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, CP ID 55900, and

Deutsche Bank AG, CP ID 92230

Credit has verified that the correct legal name should be Deutsche Bank, AG.
A record in that name was just created in GCP in Feb '01.  In order to
preserve the history on the old record, and since one name is just an
abbreviated form of the other, I will make the correction on the older
record, 55900 to change it to "AG" and suspend the newer record, 92230,
pending inactivation on 04/01/01.  This is not an overlay, so I wanted to
provide some explanation in advance.

Please note the overlays.  These changes were made in GCP today, with the
noted exception.  The summary of those changes are on the "Mar 01 Changes"
tab (refer to bottom left corner), to see the detail for those entries, see
the "Mar 2001" bottom tab.

Shortname changes will be coordinated w/ ERMS IT on Friday, March 16.

Hi Molly:

Punit Rawal is a Carnegie Mellon student that Kevin Kindall and Bob Lee
interviewed back in December.  We would like to bring him in for an
interview.  He is definately a "Trading support" prospect.

I forwarded his resume to John Lavorato back in December and inquired
as to whether he would be interested in interviewing him or not, but have
had no response, except that he has not had a chance to look at his
resume yet.

Vince originally said that either John or Gary Hickerson might be interested.
I did not send his resume to Gary, maybe you can check with him?

I would like to remind everyone it is very critical that we send out accurate
invoices to our customers.  It is our responsibility to review the reports
ahead of time (Measurement, Preliminaries, etc).  I feel very strongly
that we should NOT be taking comp days on critical accounting days.
As I have stated in previous memos this is mainly, reservation close day,
the day before commodity close and commodity close day.

You should also be considerate of your team when scheduling vacation
around these days and ensure you have SPECIFIED proper back up.
It is still your responsibility to ensure your invoices are properly reviewed
and sent out whether you are in the office or not.

Hello all:

I have some "good" news and I have some "bad" news.  The "good" news
is that we are growing!  The "bad" news is that we are running out of space.

Therefore,  just for the summer we need to use Jose's and Joe's offices
on the 19th floor for "summer" interns.

I will have to remove the extensions from those offices so they won't be
ringing all the time.  However, we can put them back after the summer is
over.

I hope this is not too inconvenient for you, but with Roman and Jason needing
spaces on the 19th floor, and another new hire coming on board, we are left
without any extra spaces.

conducted like a "brown bag"  (everyone bring their own lunch).

The seminar is mandatory for every member of the group who
started after January 1, 2000.   However, all other members of
the group are invited to participate.

The books have been ordered and hopefully will arrive by the
day of the first meeting.

Karen, no problem.  I just want to be sure we are all learning
and it sounds like you had some challenges which gave you some
added training.  Hang in there.  The 8:00 a.m. Final does get

By now I'm sure that you've heard about the upcoming electric industry class
that has been customized for GPG staff.   The purpose of the class is to
learn about electric utilities as our customers, learn about some of the
current regulatory and legislative debates and the impact on us, and to learn
about the economics of electric generation.

The class will be held on August 25 at the Downtown Houston Doubletree Hotel,
Granger Rooms A & B  from 8-5 PM.  Stan Horton will open the class with
remarks on why he believes GPG needs to learns about economics and trends in
the electric industry.  The class includes a full day of course work and a
working lunch will be served.   A  workbook is being prepared and will be
distributed to you a week prior to the class.

I hope you can attend.  Similar industry classes can cost upwards of $600 per
student.   Our customized class can accommodate up to 100 attendees.   Please
RSVP to Ruth Mann by email by August 8 if you plan to attend.  Once I get a
count of attendees from this list, I will open the class up to other GPG
attendees.

They will no longer use your social security number as the id on your

In order for Anita and myself to continue to do your expense reports, we

It seems to me that we can proceed one of 2 ways.  Those alternatives are as follows:
1.  We could write a letter to Texaco and demand payment for the withheld amount.
2.  If we are paying them this month, we could withhold the $1.5 million from the
amount we are paying them.  Of course, we would need to provide them some
sort of explanation.
My preference at this time would be to do the first item.  If you could have someone provide me with the details of the transaction they withheld the money on I could draft the letter.  If that letter brought no response, then we could consider taking the action outlined in the second item.
I trust all is well with you.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Attached is the FINAL report for Nov 2000.  The additions to the preliminary
report have been highlighted.

Please note that on the preliminary report for this month, Sempra Energy
Solutions, LLC  ("Solutions") was listed under old record information to be
inactivated on 12/01/00, and Sempra Energy Sales LLC  ("Sales") was listed as
the new record information.  For the documentation received, this information
was correct, HOWEVER, there was a subsequent change for which there is no
documentation.  I have verified with the Counterparty that "Sales" was a
fictiticious name used to distinguish the Kentucky office from the California
office.  Through reorganization, it was decided that both offices would use
the "Solutions" name.  Since "Solutions" already existed and "Sales" is a
fictitious name, they had no documentation to support that change.  The
"Sales" record has been suspended pending inactivation on 12/01.

is the difference in price of these two copiers?  Is there any way we could

2) I  previously gave Mary my comments and told her I was fine.  I believe I
have seen her response to Petro-Canada.  As to the reimbursement agreement, I
believe it is in Clement's stack to work on.  I will call him to see where he
stands.

Due to the larger than normal volume of activity, the report is being
distributed earlier this month.  The goal here is to give everyone more time
to move deals and contracts on those records scheduled for inactivation on
03/01/01.    You have received notification on the name changes as they have
occurred.

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for February
15.  To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable
Macros and Read Only.
Please note that:
ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central
Time, and
Inactivations will be made on Mar 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly
reformatted.  Key points are:
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format,
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

Hello all:

If you think any of your people would be interested in the following - please
pass the messages on.

Thanks!
******************************************************************************
**************************************
Message One

Dear everyone,

We understand the as members of Enron Research group, all of us are working
on very interesting projects, some of which are ground-breaking, and we all
keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology.  We also find
out, through our own experience, that at this age of information explosion,
it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep
abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department, let
alone in the industry.  It is also our personal experience that many a
project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of
this group.

As a remedy, we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag
lunch group meeting, once every two weeks on Friday, for about 50 minutes.
It is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new
technology and development, as well as with each other,s work, so that we do
not have to reinvent the wheels.

We envision the following: In this meeting (or seminar), each one of us will
take turns to make presentations to the group. The topics could range from
theoretical consideration to practical implementation, be it option pricing,
process modelling, insurance issue, or Monte Carlo simulation, or anything
one finds fascinating.  The presentation material could be papers you have
been reading recently, projects you are working on,  some problem that
bothers you, or an idea that is fascinating. You  choose your own
presentation style.  It could be
everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask, hand waving
style, or it can involve nitty-gritty, detailed derivations, anyway a style
that suits you and the topic.  Or it can simply be a dry-run for your
presentation at the next Risk Conference.  Zimin and Alex will take upon the
responsibility of organizing the seminar.

We hope the seminar will be up and running in two-three weeks. For that
purpose your support will be greatly appreciated. Please let either Zimin or
Alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and
provide a tentative schedule. Surely the rest of the group will be happy to
hear your presentation.

We encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting, either to give a
talk or just sit in.

Zimin Lu

The accounting/Market Service SGA conference is being held this year in
New Orleans on September 26 - 28.  I would like for each team to pick a
candidate to attend this meeting.  If you attended last year, it would be
good to give someone else an opportunity this year to attend.

A few of the highlights of the conference are:
Internet Billing presentation and discussion
Presentation on electric deregulation
Natural Gas Prices
Challenges and issues for electric scheduling and accounting

Please let me know who you candidate will be by Monday, August 27.
If you have any questions about the conference, you can give me, Larry or
Raetta a call.

Thanks. Lynn

Hi Vanessa:

You will need to fill out a "Churn Request" and forward it to the "Move Team"
they will take care of everything that you put on the form.  I am attaching a
copy
of the form for your information.  The receiving department is responsible
for
doing this.  He will need boxes to pack his belongings (ask him how many
he needs - he will have to do the packing).  The only item that moves other
than his personal items, is his telephone.  The computer, chair, etc.
belongs to
the Research Group.

If you have any questions, or need help, please let me know.

Grant has been a very important part of the Research Group's growth and
stability within Enron and he will be deeply missed.

We wish him the very best in his new venture and want to send him off with
all the "good" wishes and support that he deserves.  However, since I
will be out of town all next week,  we will postone the "Good Luck and
Best Wishes" party for Grant until sometime within the next 3 weeks.  An

Please take a minute to wish Grant the "Best".

However, we need to be reimbursed for these expenses and I would like
to know the best way to do this.  Our accounting dept. thought we should
just send an invoice with the back up material to Dabhol Power Co. asking
them to cut a check made payable to Enron Corp. and then it would be
credited to our Co# and RC#.

Please let me know if this is acceptable, and if so, who the invoice should
be made out to and where I should send it.

I appreciate your assistance in this matter.

The help desk was paged at 7:35 a.m. to report the problem , Toby responded, but was having trouble reaching the on call TMS. We did not get a response until 8:55 a.m. from TMS , the EDI files were in the HUB for over two hours. Mary Draemer was very helpful and made follow up calls so we could relay an estimated time frame to our customers when this problem would be resolved. Monday 12/31/2001 we also experienced printer problems , we were told that a print server was down, the Solution Center was redirecting print servers on an individual basis at our work stations. Kathy Washington could not print this morning and had tried to contact someone at the Solution Center, and did not receive a response back for quite a while, we went through the Help desk (Toby) and either he contacted Glen or Glen responded to the earlier page, We had several technical problems to work through this morning, but the most critical problem was trying to reach our support people.

Hello everyone.

This memo only applies to the Research group on the 19th floor that use
the colored printer "Taj Mahal".

Vince has requested that I ask each of you to only use the colored printer
"Taj Mahal" for presentations, newsletters, etc. that require at least 90%
of color.  These cartridges are very expensive and several times we have
picked up a copy of something that only had color on the first page and it
would be maybe 15-20 pages long.  This is not cost effective.

If you have something that has color on the first page, but not on the rest
of the presentation, then please just print the first page on the color
printer
and the rest on "Bandit" or "Wagon".

Your help will be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

Good morning all:

The question has arisen as to whether Enron has "personal days", that,
you can take in case of repair problems at home; car problems; sick spouse,
sick child, etc.

I checked with HR and the Policy Manual and the answer is "no", but they
can be designated at the discretion of the supervisor.  I talked this over
with Vince and he has decided that the Research Group will be allowed
two (2) personal days per year to take care of personal business and
not have to take a vacation day, discretionary day, or leave of absence.

If you have advance notice (such as an air conditioner repair scheduled),
please let me know when you are going to take these days.  If an
emergency arises with no notice, please call in and let me know that you
are taking a personal day.  It will be coded on your time sheet.

These two personal days will in no way cancel or take the place of, "funeral
leave", "family leave", or "civic duty leave".  They are just a way of being
able to take care of repair problems and other personal problems that arise.
These should be very beneficial and I am sure very much appreciated by
all of us.

If you have any questions, please call me.

I discussed this with Vince Kaminski and he said that, while we would be
glad to assist you, the time involved in ordering and collecting the money
(they are pretty expensive), distributing the books, etc. would be too time
consuming for us at this time.

You can go to www.lacimagroup.com and order the books directly.  Tell
them you are ordering the books for use at Enron and they should give you
a 15% discount.

I am sorry that we cannot do this at this time.

Good afternoon Mr. Ball:

The Enron Corp. Research Group would like to conduct an informal interview
with you at your convenience.  Please give me some dates and times within
the next 2 weeks that you might be available and I will arrange the schedule.

The people that will be interviewing you are:

Grant Masson   Vice President
Vasant Shanbhogue  Vice President
Krishna Krishnarao  Director
Zimin Lu   Director
Tanya Tamarchenko  Manager
Alex Huang   Manager

Each individual interview will last approximately 15 - 20 minutes, so we
probably
should allow at least  3 hours.

If you would prefer to call me with some dates and times - I can check

Look forward to hearing from you.

Our team holiday potluck luncheon is scheduled for Tuesday, December 11 at 11:30 AM.    So dust off those cookbooks and sign up to bring a culinary creation.  The sign-up sheet is located outside Ricki's workstation (4268A).   The buffet will be set up in 42C1 (the gas control presentation room).  Room 42C2 is also reserved for seating.

Following our luncheon, we will have a Gas Logistics staff meeting at 1 PM in 39C1.  We can discuss any Enron updates and I will do my best to address any questions and concerns that you have.

At the end of our staff meeting, we'll hold our holiday raffle drawing.   We have lots of fun prizes, including many sets of sports tickets.  All Gas Logistics employee names will be entered.  You need not be present to win.

Finally, I want to fill you in on my upcoming journey.  My husband and I have been trying to adopt a young girl from Kazakhstan into our family.  The paperwork and red tape have seemed unending and I was having doubts whether it would ever happen.  Early this week I received the call that I need to travel to Kazakhstan next week to pick her up.  While I am excited to complete the adoption, I'm not terribly thrilled with the timing of being gone over the holidays and away from work at this time.  At our staff meeting, I can address any questions you have about whom to call in my absence.

I'm looking forward to our get together next week.  To the extent that you aren't able to make the luncheon, let me take this opportunity to wish you and your family a happy, safe and relaxing holiday season.

The following is the procedure Gas Logistics and Marketing have agreed to beginning this weekend to
segregate the TW and NNG morning meeting.
1.  TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting.
2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions.
3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 25, 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance.
4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting.
5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday.
6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.
If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.
I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.
Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.

reformatted.  Key points are:
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format,
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of
the month.
It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring
process.
We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

Hello Norma:

In answer to your phone message I am sending you the following information.

There is one thing you probably need to be aware of.  On the Research
list, Elena Chilkina is shown as an Analyst P/T, however, in the records she
is shown as an "Adm Coord".  This was done so that she could be considered
non-exempt and receive overtime.  However, her actual job is an analyst.

Also, Roman Zadarozhny is an analyst that rotated out of our group 6 months
ago, but was never moved to the new group.  He is now up for rotation again
and Vince said that we will just keep him until he finds a new rotation.

If you have any questions, please call me.

The following name overlays were completed in GCP this morning.  I have been unable to update the report in Livelink, due to technical problems, which will hopefully be resolved tomorrow, May 14.  If additional information is required in the meantime, please contact me.

These changes are as a result of a merger between PanCanadian Energy Corporation and Alberta Energy Corporation Ltd., effective 04/05/02.  The combined entity was renamed EnCana Corporation.

CP ID	FROM					TO				Effective Date

Please note:  PanCanadian Energy Corporation did not previously exist as a global counterparty record.  Alberta Energy Corporation Ltd. still exists in that name, as a subsidiary of EnCana Corporation.  EnCana Corporation was created as a non-trading entity in GCP under CP ID 200474.

Shortname changes will be coordinated with ERMS IT on Friday, May 17.

Ava, I have review the IP/TV anti trust and sent that to Frazier King.  Some of the others
may have done the same.  You might call Frazier and see who is still on his list of these
people.  And if my name pops up let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Professor Ronn:
Thank you for your email and I wish to respond as follows:
I have left a message with our travel agency asking if they can get you a
hotel reservation closer into town.  I will let you know.
I have ordered an overhead projector and the room already has a screen
installed.  However, there is really not room for a lectern.  The overhead
will
sit on the end of the large conference table and most have room to use part
of the table for their presentation copies.
I will be glad to make copies for you, however, it would be a big help if you
could email me a copy of your presentation on Wednesday.  Thursday
mornings around here get pretty hectic sometimes and we may not have
time to make the copies.
I hope this meets with your approval.  Please let me know if you need
anything else.
We look forward to your visit.
Regards,

Florida is great.  We have been on the go all day and its been after business hours when I've gotten back to the house so I didn't get to talk to you.  But I have been reading my emails along the way and know about all the meetings next week.  And we can send out an email on our staff meeting on Monday.

Disney was great and I've been to 8 baseball games. Today we're going to an Astros practice and then we catch our flight home.

See you Monday

Tangie, I had a call from Delaine yesterday and she and several others want to come down
the week of August 20th to clean up all issues.  I said let me know who is coming.  She is
sending me a list.  Hopefully we can resolve this at that time.  Does that work for you?
Also, are you here that week of August 20?  Thanks. Lynn

David, As long as the long descriptions have not changed and the traders are
fine with the short description changes as being clearer, I have no problems
with the changes on the financial side.  Stacy will respond on the physical
gas side.
