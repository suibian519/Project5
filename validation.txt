We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to
sell power onto the grid to EPMI.  Below is a brief outline of the FERC
licenses required.  Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF
industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC.  In
most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless their
primary business is as a utility, like Enron).
In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform
certain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site
generation customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let
you know when we receive it and what we can do for customers.

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success.

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.

Where we terminate for a Change in Law or utility non performance, we
calculate our Early Termination Payment; if there is a Loss, we get paid; if
there is a Gain, we pay customer
Early Termination Payment on Default is set up to be one way.  Carol, Jeff

bankruptcy, or forward contract reason for us to go with 2 way payments here.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available.

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South ,
The Sky Ring
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

PJM West is scheduled to go into operation January 1, 2002 (there is some talk that the IT vendors are somewhat behind schedule do to the priority of getting NYC back in operation and that this may delay the startup - I will keep you posted).  On Day 1 of operation, PJM West will be the Allegheny control area only.  Work is progressing on Duquesne and the earliest date I have heard for integration of Duquesne into PJM West is sometime in the 1st quarter of 2002.  PJM West and PJM proper will be integrated such that there is one energy market (day-ahead and real-time) across the entire region, based on LMP, and no pancaking of transmission rates (pay the rate of the transmission system at point of withdrawal just as is done in PJM today).  However, there will be two different capacity markets - ICAP in PJM and ACAP in PJM West - to reflect the difference in reliability standards of the two NERC regions.

PJM has recently announced PJM West market trials for the Day-Ahead market on Nov 21 and Nov 28.  Real-time energy market trials are scheduled to be conducted starting on Nov 26 and continuing through Dec 31.  For additional information regarding the market trial see the enclosed notice from PJM.

Las Vegas:  Meetings and site visits scheduled with Northland, Black Hills and Allegheny.  All have registered a lot of time on Dealbench.  Northland brought there investment bankers (CIBC) to Portland and hired an independent engineering firm.  We will have the info memorandum prepared this week tosend out to other potential purchasers if necessary.  Still on track.

AMPS: We are negotiating with two industrials, each can take the first two units.  Oregon Steel in Portland and Geneva Steel in Utah.  Geneva is a better site (permitting and infrastructure).  High elevation in Utah will derate the output of the units, but will likely be able to run most hours.  Oregon interconnects with Portland General (good) but permit will restrict hours (3,500 hours estimate).  We need to talk this week to discuss the form of the contract and value/risk transfer between ENA and AMPS.

Wind:	We completed a term sale to Edwards Air Force Base consisting of shaped energy and green tags.  Tags came from our existing biomass tags and Texas wind.  We will purchase the balance from Pacificorp.  We expect more activity here with other feds, some of the munis and 6-7 developers that we are working with.

Generator Tolls: We are trading term sheets with Allegheny, Reliant, Idacorp, Dynegy, NRG and Constellation re our offer to sell at NP-15, Mid-C and Palo - I think we will get something done this quarter.

Longview: We met with the head of BPA this week and got confirmation that he supports our Longview process and that his agency will not slow us down with their proposed regional air study.  Finding EPC contractors has been difficult so we may start discussions with NEPCO.

DWR: Should execute the Master agreement this week which will allow short-term deals with 7 day payment.

We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline".

We have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

Our planned Re-Launch timetable is as follows:


Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with the new Buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Subusers.

A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.

Trading/Origination Coordination

We will shortly be sending you an invitation to join a meeting in which we will be discussing launch plans in more detail and looking for people to help in contacting customers on our Top 50 list. Although we have a dedicated EnronOnline marketing team, we would appreciate assistance from traders and originators who have strong relationships with our customers and can assist in getting signed PA's returned to us.

If you have any questions please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

I want to move forward with scheduling the initial meeting of the Operational Risk Management task force.  How does Tuesday, October 16th and the afternoon of Thursday, October 18th look for everyone?  Please let me know your schedule for both of these dates.  Most of the task force members have been identified, with the exception of those from GRMO and IT.  Sally Beck will identify representatives from these two areas.  I would also expect that other individuals may be consulted from time to time as additional expertise or resources or required.

I intend to schedule a two-hour block of time for this meeting.  The agenda will include, at a minimum,  the following topics:

Definition of Operational Risk for  Enron - What's in and What's Out
Preliminary Goals for Operational Risk Management (to be refined by the group)
Develop Common Language
Identify Framework for Monitoring Risk
Role of this task force  - Strategy
Set common objectives for implementation this year and a look forward to 2002
Current Initiatives
Communications Plan
Open Discussion - Other Ideas from the group
- Suggestions re other groups/individuals to include on the task force


I am excited about leading this initiative for Enron.  We have a unique opportunity to define operational risk measurement for Enron, develop reporting guidelines, and provide qualitative assessments of operational risk, all of which will be considered during the risk capital allocation process.   But most importantly, we can identify ways to mitigate Enron's exposure to operational risk.  Please call if you would like to discuss any of the above prior to the meeting.

On March 16, Martin Lin will be participating in a panel discussion with Dick
O'Neill of FERC, a rep. of Morgan Stanley, and Ed Cazalet of APX on "Market
Turmoil, Trading and Risk Management" (Harvard Electricity Group).  At the
present time, except in several limited regions, marketers do not have the
ability to hedge transmission risk by reselling it above cost.  Last year, we
approached Dick O'Neill's staff about the possibility of lifting the cap on
resales of transmission, but they were not inclined to proceed absent the use
of certain restrictions.  There have been several recent developments in
power and gas, as discussed in the attached memo.  It would be helpful for
Martin to discuss these recent orders as necessary in order to attempt to
gain support from Dick O'Neill for the idea of lifting the cap for power.
After Martin's discussion, we should consider reapproaching FERC to seek
approval.

With the recent movement in long term interest rates, I thought I would update you on Enron's exposure to Greenfield. Enron has a long term interest rate swap (which is in the money to Enron) in place with Greenfield, which has recently appreciated considerably. Preserving the value of this swap has become our top priority.

This is a quick summary of Enron's exposure to Greenfield.

Greenfield (In order of seniority):
Senior Debt			110mn
Additional Sponsor Loans	55mn (Not yet funded)
ECT Interest Rate Swap		16mn
Shareholder Loans		9mn
Equity				55mn
Total				245mn

Enron Exposure (In order of seniority):
Additional Sponsor Loans 	11mn (Not yet funded, no obligation to do so)
ECT Interest Rate Swap		16mn
Shareholder Loans		2.4mn
Equity				11mn
Total				29.4mn (Excluding Additional Sponsor Loan)

Current discussions center around a sale of the vessel to a third party. El Paso have recently submitted a letter indicating a potential bid of 210-215 million. If this sale were to be completed, Enron would recover the swap breakage of 16mn and the Shareholder loan of 2.4mn entirely, and would recover approximaetly $4 million of equity, resulting in an overall write off of approximately $7mn. The timing of this transaction is not yet certain, but our intention would be to delay until Q102. A sale to a third party at this level would represent the best possible solution for Enron, and our efforts are concentrated in this area

In discussions held last week with Jim Hughes, Jim indicated that he thought it was appropriate that his group should bear the loss associated with this transaction, as it was originally entered into because of Dabhol. The Global LNG group and the Finance group will continue to push as hard as possible to resolve this matter in the best interests of Enron, and we remain in constant liaison with the DPC group.

Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Jonathan

While we have certainly been arguing that the market can determine and include the capacity in the energy price (without the need for a reserves/icap market), the new FERC (Massey, Breathitt, Wood and Brownell) may shed some light on their current thinking in the NE order below issued 8/28/01.  While accepting the current NE program with certain changes, FERC is requiring NE to consider alternatives and report to the Commission by December 3.  Some quotes from the order:

p. 11:  "In a competitive market, the market itself is expected to provide the signals that new construction is needed.  These signals are most frequently provided in the form of supply shortages and the rise in prices that may result.  However, because it can take up to two years to construct new generation (or longer for certain types of generation) ICAP will help to ensure that this new capacity is brought on line when needed in order to avoid critical capacity shortages.  ICAP is intended to serve this purpose by creating the incentive to construct adequate capacity sooner rather than later, and to avoid the price spikes and supply disruptions that a shortage of capacity can cause... thus, a properly-structured ICAP requirement serves an important reliability function and provides an incentive for members to build or acquire needed generation in a timely manner.

While the parties ..may disagree over the appropriate methodology to price ICAP deficiencies, the underlying objective should be clear, i.e., an ICAP deficiency 	charge that will motivate participants to secure sufficient ICAP, to build new generation, and to offer that generation to others.

Future alternatives to ICAP:  Among the possible mechanisms, one such mechanism would be the acquisition of reserves on a forward basis....Another (or possibly 	complementary) option would be the use of demand side mechanisms, i.e., allowing LSEs to meet part of their capacity requirement by identifying load that would 	curtail usage, when directed by the grid operator."

This should give us more opportunities to educate the Commission on alternatives.  Thanks.

Dear everyone,

We understand the as members of Enron Research group, all of us are working
on very interesting projects, some of which are ground-breaking, and we all
keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology.  We also find
out, through our own experience, that at this age of information explosion,
it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep
abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department, let
alone in the industry.  It is also our personal experience that many a
project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of
this group.

As a remedy, we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag
lunch group meeting, once every two weeks on Friday, for about 50 minutes.
It is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new
technology and development, as well as with each other,s work, so that we do
not have to reinvent the wheels.

We envision the following: In this meeting (or seminar), each one of us will
take turns to make presentations to the group. The topics could range from
theoretical consideration to practical implementation, be it option pricing,
process modelling, insurance issue, or Monte Carlo simulation, or anything
one finds fascinating.  The presentation material could be papers you have
been reading recently, projects you are working on,  some problem that
bothers you, or an idea that is fascinating. You  choose your own
presentation style.  It could be
everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask, hand waving
style, or it can involve nitty-gritty, detailed derivations, anyway a style
that suits you and the topic.  Or it can simply be a dry-run for your
presentation at the next Risk Conference.  Zimin and Alex will take upon the
responsibility of organizing the seminar.

We hope the seminar will be up and running in two-three weeks. For that
purpose your support will be greatly appreciated. Please let either Zimin or
Alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and
provide a tentative schedule. Surely the rest of the group will be happy to
hear your presentation.

We encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting, either to give a
talk or just sit in.

On October 17, 2001 Rockland Electric Company and PJM filed with FERC a joint application for the transfer of operational control from the NYISO to PJM of certain facilities located in Northern New Jersey.  The facilities are the transmission assets in the Eastern Division of Rockland's service territory.  This includes approximately 400 MW of load in Bergen County, NJ and transmission facilities that are already directly interconnected with PJM (note that other Rockland facilities located in NJ, namely those in northern Passaic County and Sussex County (Rockland's Central and Western Divisions respectively) will not be transferred to PJM and will remain under the operational control of the NYISO since these facilities are not directly interconnected with PJM nor with Rockland's Eastern Division).  The filing requests approval of the transfer by November 30, 2001 which would allow PJM to take operational control on February 1, 2002 (the filing does not address what, if any, changes to the operation date might be if FERC does not approve this by Nov 30).  Rockland Electric is a subsidiary of Orange & Rockland Utilities which is a subsidiary of Con Edison.

The transfer adds approximately 400 MW of load and 56,000 customers (mostly residential and commercial) to PJM.  There is no increase in supply, therefore the total load of PJM is increased by 400 MW without any additional resources.  The transmission assets include 138-kV (8.3 miles), 69-kV (35.9 miles) and 35-kV (12.4 miles) transmission lines and 11 substations (the filing includes a detailed description of these assets).

Let me know if you require any additional information.

We have begun the testing phase of a broker application that will allow Brokers to execute transactions over EnronOnline on behalf of their clients.  We anticipate that there will be four brokers online when we launch on or about March 19, 2001.  Between now and the launch date we will be giving these brokers additional user ids to view prices on EnronOnline.

Listed below are the brokers that will have access and the products they will have execute rights on:

1. Amerex: Worldwide gas, power, crude products and bandwidth
2. Prebon: North American gas and power; European gas and power
3. Natsource: North American gas and power; Emissions; Coal
4. Power Merchants: US Financial Gas

All transactions which are executed by brokers on EnronOnline numbers will be free of brokerage charges.  We are under non-disclosure agreements with each of these brokers and therefore should not discuss the terms of these deals.  The brokers are particuliarly concerned about the impact with other customers if the terms of these agreements become public.

We are in discussion with other brokers to provide this same service.  I encourage you to contact us with any brokers that may have an interest in viewing and executing on EnronOnline prices.

Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results.

There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

The NoxTech tests in Scotland have been delayed by mechanical conditions in the test boiler.  It will take 2 - 3 days to perform the boiler repairs and restart the test.

While we have not been able to conduct extensive tests - the initial NOx reductions were in line with expectations.  On the downside the ammonia slip was fairly high - which will have to be addressed during the next phase of testing.

Assuming MB can get the boiler fixed - expect to have more complete test results by the end of the week.  It is still our intent to find a financial player (Ross - ArcLight - Cline) to buy 3 - 5% of our 50% interest in Clean Energy Solutions.  We are trying to prove a valuation of plus $20 mm for our interest - and do a "140" deal by mid - end November.

It sounds like I need to clafify my plans for trading and risk management of
power in Ontario.

1.  Garrett is in Toronto and should be doing everything possible to try to
understand all the ins and outs of the Ontario Power Market including
building forward curves.  He has dual reporting to Paul Devries (head of the
Enron's Toronto operation) and Dana Davies (head of ENA power trading for the
Northeast U.S.).  Dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for
Ontario.

2.  My current opinion is that we should trade Ontario out of the Toronto
office with risk management responsibilities rolling into Dana.  This could
always change in the future if it doesn't make sense.

3.  John Mckay, although he has been helping Bill out, will ultimately have
no power trading responsibilities.

4.  Tom May is the cash trader in N.Y. reporting to Dana.  I expect us to use
Tom's expertise with respect to Ontario to build up our competency there,
however, Toms' main role will be N.Y.

Password Deletion

It has been noted that many users have passwords which match or are similar
to their User ID's for internal EnronOnline applications (Stack Manager,
Product Manager, EOL Reports).

This is a significant security concern. Therefore, there will be a sweep of
ID's and passwords at the end of the day on Thursday, April 5. Any User ID's
which have passwords similar to the User ID will be subject to deletion.

Changing Your Password

Passwords can be changed in either the Stack Manager or in EOL Reports.

To change your password in the Stack Manager, once logged on, go to toolbar &
select "Help" and then select "Change Password".
The system will request you to enter your NEW password twice.

To change your passsword in EOL Reports, open the Reports application, log
in, select "Options" and "Change Password".The system will request you to
enter your NEW password twice. Please note that the password change
functionality within the Reports application is new. If it does not appear on
your menu and you are running on a standalone machine, you will need to
logout at the windows level and then login again to receive the updated
version.

If you have any questions, please call the EnronOnline Help Desk (Houston:
713 853 4357,  London: + 44 20 7783 7783)

Thank you for your assistance in preserving appropriate security.

Louise,
Cancellation charges have been the focus because the cash is provided by e-Next banks (turbopark).  The cash paid to date is less than the actual contractual obligation to date.  We do not need balance sheet cash to continue, but we need to come up with B/S cash if we terminate.  Hopefully the following clarifies:
Cash Payments to Date:
GE7FA		13,328
ST		909
HRSG		1480
Interest 	350
Total:		16,067
Next Payments:
GE7FA		1,566		Nov 21
ST		2,849		Dec 1
HRSG		2,960		Dec 1
These are estimates - the timing of the actual payments depends upon when the vendor completes some of the work - payment based on milestones
Cancellation Charges:
10/31:		$23MM
11/1:		$24MM
11/30:		$28.3MM
Each day from 11/1 to 11/30 the cancellation charge increases by approx $150K
DASH is based on contractual exposure, not cash out the door, hence the request at this time.  In addition to looking for opportunities to sell the equipment and the project, we are looking into the ST and HRSG contracts to make sure the vendors are not in any sort of breach.

FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing "certainty" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

A number of parties protested Entergy's Source and Sink filing at FERC based
on arguments similar to ours (discriminatory treatment of PTP
customers/Generation only control areas approved by NERC).  As you can see,
TDUs and utilities joined in on this.:

Dynegy Power Marketing
Aquila Energy Marketing
Peco Energy Co.
Municipal Energy Agency of Miss.; Lafayette Utilities System; and the
Lousiana Energy and Power Authority (who pointed out that Entergy's proposal
could,  perhaps, only work in a big, regional system and that Entergy had
left SPP)
Coral Power, ELCON and Enron
VEPCO (who now owns an approved generation only control connected to Entergy
and TVA.  VEPCO alerts FERC that Entergy already refused transmission with
a sink at the new control area, even though Entergy asks for a May 22
effective date.)
Louisiana Energy Users Group
Tenaska Power Services
El Paso Merchant Energy (asks FERC to promote gen. only control areas as
"hubs" in order to move more toward the gas model)

Finally, ComEd filed comments stating this is an important issue and FERC
should resolve this before the summer.  ComEd did not take a position on
whether Entergy's filing was good or bad.  Maybe ComEd's filing will get FERC
to deny Entergy's request before the summer, rather than setting it for
hearing!  (There so far are no filings in support of Entergy.)

Let me know if you would like a copy of any of these.

Subject: Access Card Information

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available.

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley

____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South ,
The Sky Ring
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.
To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.
Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:
Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week
Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:
Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems
Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.
Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.
Next steps
Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.
Summary
This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.
If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Enron has two mobile units that are available for placement in customer deals or in pure merchant sites.  These are 22MW, trailer-mounted and are being refurbished/packaged for delivery QIII, 2001.  In general, these units will be high heat rate, high emissions, but are cheap and available.

In order to streamline the process and facilitate information flow, I have asked Jim Buerkle to be responsible for placing these machines into income producing deals in the WSCC.  He will evaluate site alternatives, work with the Enron groups that control these machines and structure the commercial deals.  Please forward any opportunities to Jim.  If these units get placed profitably, we will likely step up to manufacture more units available for Summer 2002.

Enron has terminated the price posting agreement and has no obligation to do testing.  We have simply agreed to review their system.

During the review  anyone working with HoustonStreet should refrain from making any comments (positive or negative) concerning the performance of the system.  We will simply take the review under advisement.

Keep in mind that this could act as potential position limit set forth by UBS so be careful in completing this form.   In addition, UBS has a liquidity reserve used to adjust curves when marking P&L.    The "liquidity reserve" accounts for the fact you can't liquidate at the mid and with big positions you probably can't even liquidate at the bid (offer).

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Most of the current interconnection agreements contain language requiring a
tax gross up and, possibly, purchase of the utility's preferred meter (with
the utility to own the meter.)

First, there may be possible structures to minimize the tax gross up for
contributions in aid of construction (CIAC).  Contact ENA tax counsel when
working on these deals.

Second, Enron pipelines have allowed the customer to purchase and own its own
metering equipment, as long as such equipment meets the pipeline
requirements.  This would have tax gross up implications because the utility
would own less equipment.  Let me know if a utility is requiring metering
equipment and we would rather use and own our own equipment.

It seems like a test should include the final users of the manual entry - the fundamentals group can test it first, but Kevin Brady and Patti Sullivan are the ones that have to use it everyday.

The original 12/2001 recap sent out had an error which effected previous months plus December UAF numbers.  The problem occurred when a station was accidentally removed from the pipeline balance setup within PGAS.  The attached Recap has been corrected to include this meter and 2001 UAF does NOT look good for NNG.

Current NNG UAF:
December:	-0.81%		-1,023,077 DTH
Year to Date:	-0.39%		-5,155,854 DTH

This makes 8 months in a row of high UAF loss for NNG.

On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.  The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.

1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.

2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.

As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.

Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.

My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.

In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.

Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".

If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.

Lavo and Louise - This could be the "Alberta PPA" for 2002.   Lots of "hair" but lots of upside.

Any thoughts?

As a result of a smooth launch and market demand, we are accelerating the
timetable for the launch of several EnronOnline products.

Specifically,  after the launch of U.S. power on Monday, Dec. 13th, we will
be launching the following:

Wednesday, December 15: US Coal, U.S. Plastics, US Pulp and Paper
Thursday, December 16: Norwegian Power

Although the legal review has been completed for all of the above, I would
appreciate it if you would look once more at the products which are relevant
to your area and confirm that you are happy with them (some of you are
already in the process of doing so - thank you)

We absolutely want to avoid making changes after launch due to the problems
associated with changing descriptions on products which have already traded.

The Product Long Descriptions can be seen in the Product Manager by expanding
the Product Type in the tree to show each of the dependent Products, then
right-clicking the Product, selecting View and then pressing the View
Description button which appears on the pop-up window.

We are not done.  On Friday when we were prepared to sign, Black Hills Energy Capital said they needed until today to get a signature from their parent, Black Hills Corp.  At noon today they said that the signature was on its way.  At 4:00PM we heard that they will issue a L/C instead of the Corp guarantee.  The L/C approach is fine, but I am concerned with this flaky behavior.

Our plan is to sign the purchase and sale with Black Hills Energy Capital tonight/tomorrow morning.  They would have the obligation to deliver either a gurantee or an L/C for $15MM by Thursday.  If not, we can terminate at any time prior to close of business Monday.  I will update when something changes.

As our business continues to grow and change, Energy Operations is challenged
daily to ensure best practices throughout all services provided.  We recently
decided to consolidate the Risk Management, Deal Validation and Operational
Analysis functions into one group, directed under the management of a
Business Controller.  I am pleased to announce that Steve Venturatos has
accepted the role of Business Controller for Texas/Upstream Operations,
reporting to me.  Additionally, Dave Baumbach has agreed to serve as the Lead
of the group.  Other additions to the group include Jody Crook, a first year
analyst, and Ami Chokshi.  Ami will continue to serve as the account manager
for both Entex and TUFCO.  The attached oranizational chart identifies all
team members.  Additionally, the Denver trading books will be transitioned
from Will Kelly (who is assuming the Business Controller role for the East
region) to our group.  We will also be working with Keith McIver and John
Peyton to establish risk books for the drilling day rate trading anticipated
to kick off soon.

Mike Eiben has assumed responsiblities previously managed by Steve Venturatos
which include Global Contracts and Facilities, System Enhancements and
Regulatory Reporting.  Clem Cernosek will be joining the Logistics team in a
trouble shooting capacity.  Jennifer Pattison will be joining Volume
Management, focused on trouble shooting and UA4.  Both Clem and Jennifer have
been on the Unify - POPS team.

Please join me in sharing this information with pertinent staff members, and
in wishing each of these employees success in thier new roles.

The first group of trading contracts will go out to 77 companies for a total of 168 counterparties (most companies have multiple entities).  This group obviously does not include everyone, but we have most of our major relationships (and it is the official list that has been submitted to UBS for credit approval.)

The general marketing plan is as follows:
- Contact all customers this week to tell them about UBS Warburg Energy
- Get contract/PA packages in front of First Priority counterparties this week
- Arrange meetings or follow-up calls as appropriate
- Dave Forster and the ubswenergy.com team will be sending out online PA packages to all parties later this week (so it is important to have contacted all customers)
- Once the initial wave of contracts is out and review/negotiations are uderway, we will submit a Second Priority list for credit approval

The attached file has all of the First Priority counterparties, along with names for gas, power, online, credit and legal.   Apologies for the imperfect information - it came from several different sources.  In addition, we have columns for describing the type of agreement and its status (not pursuing, incomplete, done).  Please complete and/or edit the attached and forward to either Debra Bailey or Lloyd Will.  If you think you should take the lead on a particular counterparty, call up the other person and work it out!  Progress on this effort will be reviewed during our twice-weekly calls.

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for
the industrials).
Specifics:
Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities"
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice
filing).
-- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial;
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while
they are selling at wholesale.
-- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be
separate from our big quarterly reports.
-- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.
West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to
purchases from industrials in WSCC.
____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6,
2001.

Here is my recommendation for the liquidation of EMW.  I would like to transact as early as Monday, so let me know if we need to clear any other hurdles before transacting.

1. Terminate all physical and financial deals between ENA and EMW. (approximate $24.5 million loss to EMW and gain to ENA).  The loss will be removed from EMW's commodity book and recorded in Schedule E. This creates a payable on ENA and a receivable on EMW.  Jeff - can  you help create a document that terminates all transactions with ENA starting in Feb 02?

2. Sell all NSS inventory to PGL at current market price (expected proceeds $24 million in Cash).  I think both parties are agreeable to using the relevant published Gas Daily price on the trade date. EMW will generate transaction confirmation under the master purchase agreement

4. Cash proceeds will be used to pay down I\C payable with ENA.  Cash will be expected on trade date.

5. EMW will continue to show its receivable from ENA from the termination of the hedges and the I\C payable to ENA on its balance sheet.  Accounting is researching if netting these amounts is appropriate.  EMW will carefully monitor these balances.  It is important that the I\C balance not be reduced to an amount less than its receivable to ENA.  Additional income \ cash generated in EMW will be moved to enovate to prevent future I\C pay down.  We hope to have the accounting for Dec activity finished soon.

EMW's books will be left with some demand charge related to the Trunkline deal and may have some other "sleaving" transactions such as the ROG transaction.  I will work with Phyllis and Mark to finalize the NSS program Year 2 and calculate a demand credit, if any, to PGL.  I expect EMW to remain dormant, except for the above, until a final decision is made on it status.

Shelley,  Tim is looking into these balances.  Tejas has an imbalance we're checking into that developed in December for 211K.  It appears estimates were used for actual flow & we don't have a lot of confidence that that much gas actually flowed.  Mike Wagner tells me the check meter is not working and he has had no luck getting anyone to fix it.  Tim is following up w/Tejas to find out what the actual flow for Dec was.  Also, we're currently working trying to take some of the balances in payback to cover FPL working off their imbalance during the outages we have in process.  We're implementing a process with the team to ensure scheduled quantites are tied out each month so Tim & Cynthia can concentrate on actual flow volumes and reconciliation of any old unreconciled imbalances.

We had a good visit with the FERC staff yesterday.  Their questions primarily
focused on the business aspects of EOL (for example, how the different
business units of trading and accounting/back office interface with the
software and engineering aspects of EOL).  The attorney had two outstanding
questions:

1.  What regulations govern EOL or the trades done on EOL?
2.  What types of internal controls are in place with regard to risk
management of Enron's gas and power trading.  For example, what is the
ability of Enron to take a position that could potentially affect the
industry as a whole?

We plan to coordinate a possible call to the FERC attorney by regarding the
regulation question.  In addition, Steve Kean plans to coordinate a call to
the attorney with Rick Buy (or other appropriate risk management personnel.)

I would like to send these to Kim Bruno at FERC later today.

An additional FYI.  Connie Lausten of the U.S. House Government Reform Committee made a request to Enron's DC office to see the trading floor operations in addition to holding a discussion about Enron Online.  She is to meet with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor on Friday, July 13th at 9am.  John Shelk from our DC office told me when people on the Hill say "Enron OnLine" they mean not only the online trading platform itself, but the broader subject of financial products and energy  trading, whether online or otherwise.  John said that the interest coming from the Hill is broader than the platform alone and reflects in many ways a lack of understanding of the benefits of what we do in this area.  We will be coordinating this with the DC office.

Legal folks -- please let me know of any other legal people who should be
added to interconnection issue emails.
On May 16, FERC clarified its policy regarding credits for network upgrades
associated with the interconnection of a generating facility -- all network
upgrade costs (the cost of all facilities from the point where the generator
connects to the grid), including those necessary to remedy short-circuit and
stability problems, should be credited back to the customer that funded the
upgrades once the delivery service begins.
Once a customer signs up for transmission, then the transmission provider is
limited to charging the higher of the expansion cost or an embedded cost rate.
Generally, Enron has not procured transmission at the time of interconnection
and therefore, may be required to pay the network upgrades at the time of
interconnection; however, the order clarifies that a credit should be
available to the interconnecting customer or a third party that contracts for
transmission away from the generator.

As you know, Enron,s United Way Executive Solicitation is well under way.
August 9th is the target date to achieve 100% participation and finalize the
commitment from our executives and is also the date for the kickoff of the
company wide drive.  We have a way to go to meet this objective.  As of
August 3rd less than 25% of our executives have turned in their pledge.
Enron,s United Way goal for the year is $2.3 million (before the corporate
match). ENA,s share of this goal is $346,500.  While these are aggressive
goals, they are very doable, and if everyone contributes their fair share, we
can easily surpass these goals.

Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I,d like to have 100%
participation throughout the organization.  This is especially important
among our executives.  We define "participation" as an employee who has
completed their pledge on-line and made a contribution, no matter what the
level.

I am a proud member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society, which is a
contributor of $10,000 or more and have pledged significantly more this year
than last year.  Enron has 39 members of this Society, only 5 of which are
from ENA.  I would like to see this number increase significantly and if you
are able, I would like you to consider stepping up to this level.  Given the
fact that Enron executives are highly compensated with generous options and
bonus program, I encourage each of you to at least become a member of the
"Make a Difference" Club, which is a contribution of 1.2% of your annual
salary.  I would also challenge each of you to increase your pledge this
year, regardless of your level of giving last year.

With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I,ll need the
support of you and your campaigners to increase participation levels across
the ENA organization and reach our financial goals.  Whatever your decision
regarding the level of your pledge, we need 100% participation from our
Executives in order to set a good example for the rest of ENA.  Your
contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our
community.  When you give, you change a life right here in our community.

Please join me in setting the standard for ENA by giving generously and
getting your pledges in by August 9th.

Attached is a file with a page for each month showing cash in's and cash out's with totals for each and detail of each.
These are volumes after bookout.  I pulled this information from TSS Invoicing for each month and sorted it by volume amounts.  The majority\minority categories are based on the numbers of customers that were in either cash in or cash out, rather than on the volume.  If the majority\minority categories are based on volume, then three months change: Oct 00, Nov 00, and April 01.

Let me know if this is what you needed or if there are other reports I can pull.  I will also send this to Jim Studebaker, maybe he can incorporate it into his spreadsheet of prices.

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

I talked to Lavila Lawrence with Duke Energy Field Services, LP. and she advised me that the GPM Dumas Plant (POI 18058) is going to be shutdown effective January 1, 2002.  They will diverting some of the gas to other pipelines and any gas that will be coming to NNG will come through interconnects that David Moon takes care of in the Texas Panhandle.
She said "They wouldn't have to de-rhime that plant anymore!", which gave me the impression that the cost of maintenance might be the reason for the shutdown.

Gary Spraggins and Kay Threet have agreed to an OBA Payback of 5,000 dth at POI 158 - Tex Harvey (Delivery to them) and
POI 152 - Reeves (Receipt back to NNG).  This is creates a "zero" net effect on the pipe.

The Payback at Reeves will increase from 5,000 to 10,000 dth with this payback.  The first 5,000 dth reflects a similiar payback agreement where the payback is at POI 1709 - Duke - Linam Ranch (Delivery to Duke).

This will have OneOk Westex's OBA's near zero by the end of the month.

Fortunately, some of us don't need 50 years to figure most of these things
out!

THINGS THAT IT TOOK ME FIFTY YEARS TO LEARN
(by DAVE BARRY)

1. Never under any circumstances take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the
same night.

2. If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not
achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word would be
"meetings."

3. There is a very fine line between "hobby" and "mental illness."

4. People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want
you to share yours with them.

5. And when God, who created the entire universe with all of its glories,
decides to deliver a message to humanity, He WILL NOT use, as His
messenger, a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle.

6. You should not confuse your career with your life.

7. No matter what happens ... somebody will find a way to take it too
seriously.

8. When trouble arises & things look bad, there is always one individual who
perceives a solution & is willing to take command. Very often, that person is
crazy.

9. Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance.

10. A person who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a nice person.

11. Never lick a steak knife.

12. Take out the fortune before you eat the cookie.

13. The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender,
religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down inside, we
ALL believe that we are above average drivers.

14. You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests that
you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her
at that moment.

Lockyer writes a very belated letter to the LA Times---"regret" of the slimy
variety:

My comment about introducing an energy company executive to the ugly reality
of a prison cell was repeated recently by columnist Peter King (June 10) and
has become fodder for commentaries that suggest I might think that prison
rape is proper punishment for criminals.
My anger over the activities of energy barons doesn't come close to my
lifelong outrage at the crime of rape. As attorney general I significantly
reordered my department's priorities in order to complete the DNA offender
database this year. I also sponsored new laws to help fight rape crimes. My
office prosecuted prison guards charged with encouraging inmate rapes at
Corcoran State Prison.
I guess I let my anger get the better of me in talking about the mercenary
corporate executives who are making life so miserable for millions of
Californians. I should have made my point--that even the most powerful
corporate executives are not beyond the law--without the crude remark.

Tracy and James,

Elaine and Phil thought it would be nice to include this summary page in the plan review package for Stan's review next week.


I think Rod mentioned that Stan has set a target for Phil of 5.0MM for 2002.  Please advise if this is still valid because Phil personally has not heard that from Stan.  The numbers that we have in Adaytum match the $4.4 MM net contribution.  The remaining $0.6MM are salary offsets on NNG.  42P does not have employees and they use NNG employees.  When they do that, NNg charges the salaries of the employees for the applicable # of hours to 42P.  Therefore,  42P covers expenses that NNG would have to bear otherwise.  Phil feels that the $0.6MM of salaries offsets should be counted toward the 5.0 target since it's a benefit that 42P brings to NNG.  James and I talked about this on the phone.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks!

I talked to Steve in NNG Gas Control to see why we had such a difference in the PVR Shrink for the 26th.  He is showing the volume for the PVR measured @ 96.7 which would be only a 2,481 difference and make the monthly only 4,654 difference.  I also went out into PGAS and confirmed the volume measured was indeed 96.7 dth.  Apparently we have an issue between PGAS and the TMS system.

Subject: We Need You


Some of you were contacted earlier this year by Cliff Baxter, Enron's
representative on the Junior Achievement Board of Directors, regarding
participation in Enron's Junior Achievement program.  Since so many changes
have occurred within ENA since that time, we are renewing our request and
broadening it to reach more departments.

One of the programs that we wish to support through Junior Achievement is Job
Shadowing.  This program's objectives are to demonstrate why a sound
education, interpersonal skills, and a strong work ethic are needed to
succeed in the work place.  A successful Job Shadowing program requires your
department's commitment and participation.

The Job Shadowing program consists of the following:

9:00 - 10:30 AM  Welcome, Company Overview, Video, and Tour
10:30 - 12:00 N  Job Shadow Experience with Enron Employees and/or
Departments
12:00 - 1:00 PM  Lunch for Students with Mentors and Closing Comments

Enron has agreed to accept 16 high school juniors and seniors on the second
Wednesday of each month from October 2000 through April 2001.  We need your
assistance in hosting students within your department during the 10:30 AM -
12:00 Noon period.   Students may be either paired up one-on-one with
employees or may remain in groups of 2-4.  Employees participating in Job
Shadowing will also be invited to join their students for a quick lunch and
closing comments.  If enough departments participate, it is possible that
each department may only be needed on a quarterly basis.

Although we have identified two individuals to provide the company overview
and tour, we are also accepting additional volunteers in this area.  Please
advise if anyone in your department is interested in assisting.

Please provide the following information to Nicki Daw or Susan Skarness by
August 30, 2000.

Department Name:

Job Shadowing Contact Name:

Number of Students:

Individual to Assist With Tours:

We appreciate your consideration and participation in promoting Junior
Achievement and Enron.

The area she still has concerns with is: El Paso - when is it a loop and when is it going to or from TW.  So be sure to let her know if there are any.

I let her do everything Saturday evening and with the exception of a couple of questions, she soloed.  I feel she will do fine on evenings starting Wednesday, the 26th.

I have been working closely with OneOk Westex this month in order to balance their OBA at Reeves and to date we are still approximately 17,000 dth over delivered to them.

Gary Spraggins approved and OneOk agreed to NNG set the flow control to them at 2,000 dth less that their scheduled to make this up for rest of the month.

Roy Armitage in NNG Gas Control was contacted and has made the adjustments.

The Dumas plant is going to Derhime starting at 9:00 am tomorrow, Friday March 22nd.  They will continue to flow approximately 35,000 dth of raw gas.  They DO NOT have a processing agreement with OneOk at Bushton, but the gas will physically be diverted into the B-Line due to it being raw.

The plan is for them to be down through Tuesday morning at 9:00 am, subject to changes that may extend the time.

In reviewing the Duke contract 27291, I did find that the rate was not correct for four months in the past year.  I also reviewed Duke contract 27349 since it also had the same type of alternate to California deal.  Two months on the second contract were not billed correctly.  If Marketing can input the correct rates into the system, I can regenerate the invoices and bill Duke immediately.  Please see the attached file for details.

Hillary Clinton died and went to  heaven. As she stood in front of St.
Peter at the Pearly  Gates, she saw a HUGE wall of clocks behind him.
She asked, "What are the reasons for all those clocks?"

St. Peter answered,  "Those are Lie-Clocks. ... Everyone on Earth has
a
Lie-Clock.  Every time you lie, the hands on your clock will move."

"Oh,"  said Hillary, "whose clock is that?"

"That's Mother Teresa's.  The hands have never moved, indicating that
she has never told a  lie in all her long life."

"And whose clock is that?", said  Hillary.

"That's Abraham Lincoln's clock. The hands have only moved twice,
telling us that Honest Abe only told 2 lies in his entire life."

"Where's Bill's clock?" Hillary  asked.

"Bill's clock is in Jesus' office.  He's using it as a ceiling fan.

By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you
with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very
important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to
gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their
associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs
real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and
project costing are negatively impacted.

We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at
3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline.
Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Todd Peikert,
the site manager for the Corporate groups, on what you need to do before June
30th.

Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry
periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE)
at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.

We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a

Hello Everyone,

I will be coordinating with IT to ensure our migration to Outlook 2000 (GEM
Project) happens smoothly and successfully.  I will inform you of information
needed or timelines as I am made aware of them.  I'm in the process of
providing them the initial information for our group.  After they receive it
they will send me more details of how the process will take place and how
long it will take to complete.  Please hold your questions until you receive
that email.  If you have something you would like to address after you
receive that e mail we will proceed as needed.

The first step for you, is to go through your lotus notes and start wiping
out personal e mails and data that can be converted to a spreadsheet or word
document.  We will have access to our lotus notes for a period of time (will
have to get specifics from IT) but will not be sending or receiving e mails
through the Lotus Notes Database once we have migrated over.

Again, I will keep you posted as I receive information.  Thank you for your

The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations.

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the survey.

Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for contributing to this important learning opportunity.

To complete the GLOBE Network Survey, please click on the link below and simply follow the survey instructions.  You will need to enter the Enron Company Code, which is:

C673EV

Sherri, here's the info you need.  I would recommend that they both join the
cycling club at $35 each, and then we will pay for their registrations.  Jeff
Skilling's has already been paid for even though he hasn't paid his dues for
2001.  Effectively,  the bike club pays the registrations through the
membership fees, and his daughter would be eligible to join with him, so if
you could forward me a check for $70, and get his/her membership and her
MS150 form back to me, I'll take care of everything.  (We already have Jeff's
MS150 registration done, as I said.)
On the fundraising:  Please mention to Jeff that BP, who is the main sponsor
of this year's tour, has issued a challenge to Enron.  They are seriously out
to beat us out of first place and they claim that they already have 400
riders.  We, of course, don't want that to happen, although we are pleased
with the jump-start we have given to the Houston corporate world in relation
to this ride.  I'm encouraging our current team members to raise their
fundraising as much as possible, and especially our top people.  Do you think
we could get Jeff to $100,000 this year?  Last year he came in at $65,000.
Wendy Gramm is not riding this year because Phil Gramm has a high school
reunion the same night, so could Jeff ask Wendy to raise money anyway and
throw it our way, or she could just raise the money and give herself the
credit even though she's not riding?  Do you have any ideas on that?  Do you
want me to contact her to discuss or would it be better for you or Rebecca to
do that?
